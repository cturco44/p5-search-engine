science that aims to create it AI textbooks define the field as the study and design of intelligent agents where an agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chances of success John McCarthy who coined the term in 1956 defines it as the science and engineering of making intelligent machinesThe field was founded on the claim that a central property of humans intelligencethe sapience of sapienscan be so precisely described that it can be simulated by a machineSee the Dartmouth proposal under Philosophy below This raises philosophical issues about the nature of the mind and the ethics of creating artificial beings issues which have been addressed by myth fiction and philosophy since antiquity Artificial intelligence has been the subject of optimismThe optimism referred to includes the predictions of early AI researchers see optimism in the history of AI as well as the ideas of modern transhumanists such as Kurzweil but has also suffered setbacksThe setbacks referred to include the ALPAC report of 1966 the abandonment of perceptrons in 1970 the Lighthill Report of 1973 and the collapse of the lisp machine market in 1987 and today has become an essential part of the technology industry providing the heavy lifting for many of the most difficult problems in computer scienceAI research is highly technical and specialized and deeply divided into subfields that often fail to communicate with each other Subfields have grown up around particular institutions the work of individual researchers the solution of specific problems longstanding differences of opinion about how AI should be done and the application of widely differing tools The central problems of AI include such traits as reasoning knowledge planning learning communication perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects General intelligence or AI is still among the fields long term goals HistoryThinking machines and artificial beings appear in myths such as Talos of Crete the bronze robot of Hephaestus and Pygmalions Galatea Human likenesses believed to have intelligence were built in every major civilization animated images were worshipped in Egypt and Greece and humanoid automatons were built by Yan Shi of Alexandria and AlJazari It was also widely believed that artificial beings had been created by ibn Hayyn Loew and Paracelsus By the 19th and 20th centuries artificial beings had become a common feature in fiction as in Shelleys Frankenstein or apeks Rossums Universal Robots McCorduck argues that all of these are examples of an ancient urge as she describes it to forge the gods Stories of these creatures and their fates discuss many of the same hopes fears and ethical concerns that are presented by artificial intelligenceMechanical or formal reasoning has been developed by philosophers and mathematicians since antiquity The study of logic led directly to the invention of the programmable digital electronic computer based on the work of mathematician Turing and others Turings of computation suggested that a machine by shuffling symbols as simple as 0 and 1 could simulate any conceivable act of mathematical deductionThis insight that digital computers can simulate any process of formal reasoning is known as the thesis This along with concurrent discoveries in neurology theory and cybernetics inspired a small group of researchers to begin to seriously consider the possibility of building an electronic brainThe field of AI research was founded at a conference on the campus of College in the summer of 1956 The attendees including John McCarthy Minsky Newell and Simon became the leaders of AI research for many decades They and their students wrote programs that were to most people simply astonishingRussell and Norvig write it was astonishing whenever a computer did anything kind of smartish  computers were solving word problems in algebra proving logical theorems and speaking English By the middle of the 1960s research in the US was heavily funded by the Department of Defense and laboratories had been established around the world AIs founders were profoundly optimistic about the future of the new field Simon predicted that machines will be capable within twenty years of doing any work a man can do and Minsky agreed writing that within a generation  the problem of creating artificial intelligence will substantially be solvedThey had failed to recognize the difficulty of some of the problems they facedSee  In 1974 in response to the criticism of James Lighthill and ongoing pressure from the US Congress to fund more productive projects both the US and British governments cut off all undirected exploratory research in AI The next few years when funding for projects was hard to find would later be called the winterIn the early 1980s AI research was revived by the commercial success of systems a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of one or more human experts By 1985 the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars At the same time Japans generation computer project inspired the US and British governments to restore funding for academic research in the field However beginning with the collapse of the Machine market in 1987 AI once again fell into disrepute and a second longer lasting winter beganIn the 1990s and early 21st century AI achieved its greatest successes albeit somewhat behind the scenes Artificial intelligence is used for logistics mining diagnosis and many other areas throughout the technology industryThe success was due to several factors the increasing computational power of computers see law a greater emphasis on solving specific subproblems the creation of new ties between AI and other fields working on similar problems and a new commitment by researchers to solid mathematical methods and rigorous scientific standardsOn 11 May 1997 Deep Blue became the first computer

leadingedge definition of artificial intelligence research is changing over time One pragmatic definition is AI research is that which computing scientists do not know how to do costeffectively today For example in 1956 character recognition OCR was considered AI but today sophisticated OCR software with a contextsensitive checker and checker software comes for free with most scanners No one would any longer consider alreadysolved computing science problems like OCR artificial intelligence todayLowcost entertaining chessplaying software is commonly available for tablet computers DARPA no longer

AI breakthrough explained but few consumers realize the technology sourceAI applications are no longer the exclusive domain of of defense RD but are now common place consumer items and inexpensive intelligent toysIn common usage the term AI no longer seems to apply to offtheshelf solved computingscience problems which may have originally emerged out of years of AI research Problems Can a machine act intelligently is still an problem Taking A machine can act intelligently as a hypothesis many researchers have attempted to build such a machineThe general problem of simulating or creating intelligence has been broken down into a number of specific subproblems These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers would like an intelligent system to display The traits described below have received the most attentionDeduction reasoning problem solving Early AI researchers developed algorithms that imitated the stepbystep reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions By the late 1980s and 90s AI research had also developed highly successful methods for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information employing concepts from probability and economicsFor difficult problems most of these algorithms can require enormous computational resources  most experience a explosion the amount of memory or computer time required becomes astronomical when the problem goes beyond a certain size The search for more efficient problem solving algorithms is a high priority for AI researchHuman beings solve most of their problems using fast intuitive judgments rather than the conscious stepbystep deduction that early AI research was able to model AI has made some progress at imitating this kind of subsymbolic problem solving agent approaches emphasize the importance of sensorimotor skills to higher reasoning net research attempts to simulate the structures inside human and animal brains that give rise to this skillKnowledge representationrightthumbAn ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those conceptsrepresentation and engineering are central to AI research Many of the problems machines are expected to solve will require extensive knowledge about the world Among the things that AI needs to represent are objects properties categories and relations between objects situations events states and time causes and effects knowledge about knowledge what we know about what other people know and many other less well researched domains A representation of what exists is an ontology borrowing a word from traditional philosophy of which the most general are called upper ontologiesAmong the most difficult problems in knowledge representation arereasoning and the problem Many of the things people know take the form of working assumptions For example if a bird comes up in conversation people typically picture an animal that is fist sized sings and flies None of these things are true about all birds John McCarthy identified this problem in 1969 as the qualification problem for any commonsense rule that AI researchers care to represent there tend to be a huge number of exceptions Almost nothing is simply true or false in the way that abstract logic requires AI research has explored a number of solutions to this problemThe breadth of knowledge The number of atomic facts that the average person knows is astronomical Research projects that attempt to build a complete knowledge base of knowledge eg Cyc require enormous amounts of laborious ontological engineering  they must be built by hand one complicated concept at a time A major goal is to have the computer understand enough concepts to be able to learn by reading from sources like the internet and thus be able to add to its own ontologyThe subsymbolic form of some knowledge Much of what people know is not represented as facts or statements that they could express verbally For example a chess master will avoid a particular chess position because it feels too exposed or an art critic can take one look at a statue and instantly realize that it is a fake These are intuitions or tendencies that are represented in the brain nonconsciously and subsymbolically Knowledge like this informs supports and provides a context for symbolic conscious knowledge As with the related problem of subsymbolic reasoning it is hoped that situated AI or intelligence will provide ways to represent this kind of knowledgePlanningImageHierarchicalcontrolsystemsvgthumb A control system is a form of system in which a set of devices and governing software is arranged in a hierarchyIntelligent agents must be able to set goals and achieve them They need a way to visualize the future they must have a representation of the state of the world and be able to make predictions about how their actions will change it and be able to make choices that maximize the utility or value of the available choicesIn classical planning problems the agent can assume that it is the only thing acting on the world and it can be certain what the consequences of its actions may be However if this is not true it must periodically check if the world matches its predictions and it must change its plan as this becomes necessary requiring the agent to reason under uncertaintyplanning uses the cooperation and competition of many agents to achieve a given goal behavior such as this is used by algorithms and intelligenceLearninglearning has been central to AI research from the beginningTuring discussed the centrality of learning as early as 1950 in his classic paper Machinery and Intelligence  In 1956 at the original Dartmouth AI summer conference Solomonoff wrote a report on unsupervised probabilistic machine learning An Inductive Inference Machinepdf scanned copy of the original version published in 1957 An Inductive Inference Machine IRE Convention Record Section on Information Theory Part 2 pp 5662learning is the ability to find patterns in a stream of input learning includes both classification and numerical regression Classification is used to determine what category something belongs in after seeing a number of examples of things from several categories Regression takes a set of numerical inputoutput examples and attempts to discover a continuous function that would generate the outputs from the inputs In learning the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones These can be analyzed in terms of theory using concepts like utility The mathematical analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of computer science known as learning theoryNatural language processingFileParseTreesvgthumb A tree represents the syntactic structure of a sentence according to some grammarlanguage processing gives machines the ability to read and understand the languages that humans speak Many researchers hope that a sufficiently powerful natural language processing system would be able to acquire knowledge on its own by reading the existing text available over the internet Some straightforward applications of natural language processing include retrieval or mining and translationMotion and manipulationThe field of robotics is closely related to AI Intelligence is required for robots to be able to handle such tasks as object manipulation and navigation with subproblems of localization knowing where you are mapping learning what is around you and planning figuring out how to get therePerceptionperception is the ability to use input from sensors such as cameras microphones sonar and others more exotic to deduce aspects of the world vision is the ability to analyze visual input A few selected subproblems are recognition facial recognition and recognitionSocial intelligencerobot at MIT MuseumjpgthumbKismet a robot with rudimentary social skillsEmotion and social skills play two roles for an intelligent agent First it must be able to predict the actions of others by understanding their motives and emotional states This involves elements of theory theory as well as the ability to model human emotions and the perceptual skills to detect emotions Also for good interaction an intelligent machine also needs to display emotions At the very least it must appear polite and sensitive to the humans it interacts with At best it should have normal emotions itselfCreativityA subfield of AI addresses creativity both theoretically from a philosophical and psychological perspective and practically via specific implementations of systems that generate outputs that can be considered creative or systems that identify and assess creativity A related area of computational research is Intuition and ImaginationGeneral intelligenceMost researchers hope that their work will eventually be incorporated into a machine with general intelligence known as AI combining all the skills above and exceeding human abilities at most or all of them A few believe that anthropomorphic features like consciousness or an brain may be required for such a projectMany of the problems above are considered AIcomplete to solve one problem you must solve them all For example even a straightforward specific task like translation requires that the machine follow the authors argument reason know what is being talked about knowledge and faithfully reproduce the authors intention social intelligence translation therefore is believed to be AIcomplete it may require AI to be done as well as humans can do it Approaches There is no established unifying theory or paradigm that guides AI research Researchers disagree about many issuesNils Nilsson writes Simply put there is wide disagreement in the field about what AI is all about  A few of the most long standing questions that have remained unanswered are these should artificial intelligence simulate natural intelligence by studying psychology or neurology Or is human biology as irrelevant to AI research as bird biology is to engineeringCan intelligent behavior be described using simple elegant principles such as logic or optimization Or does it necessarily require solving a large number of completely unrelated problemsCan intelligence be reproduced using highlevel symbols similar to words and ideas Or does it require subsymbolic processingJohn Haugeland who coined the term GOFAI Good OldFashioned Artificial Intelligence also proposed that AI should more properly be referred to as intelligence a term which has since been adopted by some nonGOFAI researchershttpciteseerxistpsueduviewdocdownloaddoi1011388384reprep1typepdfhttpbooksgooglecombookshlenlrida

consensus on how closely the brain should be simulatedIn the 1940s and 1950s a number of researchers explored the connection between neurology theory and cybernetics Some of them built machines that used electronic networks to exhibit rudimentary intelligence such as Grey Walters turtles and the Hopkins Beast Many of these researchers gathered for meetings of the Teleological Society at University and the Club in England By 1960 this approach was largely abandoned although elements of it would be revived in the 1980s Symbolic When access to digital computers became possible in the middle 1950s AI research began to explore the possibility that human intelligence could be reduced to symbol manipulation The research was centered in three institutions CMU Stanford and MIT and each one developed its own style of research Haugeland named these approaches to AI good old fashioned AI or GOFAI Cognitive simulation Economist Simon and Newell studied human problem solving skills and attempted to formalize them and their work laid the foundations of the field of artificial intelligence as well as science research and science Their research team used the results of  psychological experiments to develop programs that simulated the techniques that people used to solve problems This tradition centered at Mellon University would eventually culminate in the development of the Soar architecture in the middle 80s Logicbased Unlike Newell and Simon John McCarthy felt that machines did not need to simulate human thought but should instead try to find the essence of abstract reasoning and problem solving regardless of whether people used the same algorithms His laboratory at Stanford SAIL focused on using formal logic to solve a wide variety of problems including representation planning and learning Logic was also focus of the work at the of Edinburgh and elsewhere in Europe which led to the development of the programming language Prolog and the science of programming Antilogic or scruffy Researchers at MIT such as Minsky and Papert found that solving difficult problems in vision and language processing required adhoc solutions  they argued that there was no simple and general principle like logic that would capture all the aspects of intelligent behavior Schank described their antilogic approaches as scruffy as opposed to the neat paradigms at CMU and Stanford knowledge bases such as Lenats Cyc are an example of scruffy AI since they must be built by hand one complicated concept at a time Knowledgebased When computers with large memories became available around 1970 researchers from all three traditions began to build knowledge into AI applications This knowledge revolution led to the development and deployment of systems introduced by Feigenbaum the first truly successful form of AI software The knowledge revolution was also driven by the realization that enormous amounts of knowledge would be required by many simple AI applications Subsymbolic During the 1960s symbolic approaches had achieved great success at simulating highlevel thinking in small demonstration programs Approaches based on cybernetics or networks were abandoned or pushed into the backgroundThe most dramatic case of subsymbolic AI being pushed into the background was the devastating critique of perceptrons by Minsky and Papert in 1969 See of AI winter or Rosenblatt By the 1980s however progress in symbolic AI seemed to stall and many believed that symbolic systems would never be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition especially perception robotics learning and recognition A number of researchers began to look into subsymbolic approaches to specific AI problems Bottomup embodied situated behaviorbased or AI Researchers from the related field of robotics such as Brooks rejected symbolic AI and focused on the basic engineering problems that would allow robots to move and survive Their work revived the nonsymbolic viewpoint of the early cybernetics researchers of the 50s and reintroduced the use of theory in AI This coincided with the development of the mind thesis in the related field of science the idea that aspects of the body such as  movement perception and visualization are required for higher intelligence Computational Intelligence Interest in networks and connectionism was revived by Rumelhart and others in the middle 1980s These and other subsymbolic approaches such as systems and computation are now studied collectively by the emerging discipline of intelligenceStatisticalIn the 1990s AI researchers developed sophisticated mathematical tools to solve specific subproblems These tools are truly scientific in the sense that their results are both measurable and verifiable and they have been responsible for many of AIs recent successes The shared mathematical language has also permitted a high level of collaboration with more established fields like mathematics economics or research Stuart Russell and Norvig describe this movement as nothing less than a revolution and the victory of the neats Critiques argue that these techniques are too focussed on particular problems and have failed to address the long term goal of general intelligence Integrating the approaches Intelligent agent paradigm An agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions which maximize its chances of success The simplest intelligent agents are programs that solve specific problems More complicated agents include human beings and organizations of human beings such as firms The paradigm gives researchers license to study isolated problems and find solutions that are both verifiable and useful without agreeing on one single approach An agent that solves a specific problem can use any approach that works  some agents are symbolic and logical some are subsymbolic networks and others may use new approaches The paradigm also gives researchers a common language to communicate with other fieldssuch as theory and economicsthat also use concepts of abstract agents The intelligent agent paradigm became widely accepted during the 1990sarchitectures and architectures Researchers have designed systems to build intelligent systems out of interacting agents in a system A system with both symbolic and subsymbolic components is a intelligent system and the study of such systems is intelligence systems integration A control system provides a bridge between subsymbolic AI at its lowest reactive levels and traditional symbolic AI at its highest levels where relaxed time constraints permit planning and world modelling Brooks architecture was an early proposal for such a hierarchical system Tools In the course of 50 years of research AI has developed a large number of tools to solve the most difficult problems in science A few of the most general of these methods are discussed below Search and optimization Many problems in AI can be solved in theory by intelligently searching through many possible solutions Reasoning can be reduced to performing a search For example logical proof can be viewed as searching for a path that leads from premises to conclusions where each step is the application of an rule Planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals attempting to find a path to a target goal a process called analysis Robotics algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use local searches in space Many learning algorithms use search algorithms based on optimizationSimple exhaustive searches are rarely sufficient for most real world problems the search space the number of places to search quickly grows to astronomical numbers The result is a search that is too slow or never completes The solution for many problems is to use heuristics or rules of thumb that eliminate choices that are unlikely to lead to the goal called pruning the tree Heuristics supply the program with a best guess for the path on which the solution liesA very different kind of search came to prominence in the 1990s based on the mathematical theory of optimization For many problems it is possible to begin the search with some form of a guess and then refine the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made These algorithms can be visualized as blind climbing we begin the search at a random point on the landscape and then by jumps or steps we keep moving our guess uphill until we reach the top Other optimization algorithms are annealing search and optimizationcomputation uses a form of optimization search For example they may begin with a population of organisms the guesses and then allow them to mutate and recombine selecting only the fittest to survive each generation refining the guesses Forms of computation include intelligence algorithms such as ant colony or swarm optimization and algorithms such as algorithms and programming Logic Logic is used for knowledge representation and problem solving but it can be applied to other problems as well For example the satplan algorithm uses logic for planning and logic programming is a method for learningSeveral different forms of logic are used in AI research Propositional or logic is the logic of statements which can be true or false logic also allows the use of quantifiers and predicates and can express facts about objects their properties and their relations with each other logic is a version of firstorder logic which allows the truth of a statement to be represented as a value between 0 and 1 rather than simply True 1 or False 0 systems can be used for uncertain reasoning and have been widely used in modern industrial and consumer product control systems logic models uncertainty in a different and more explicit manner than fuzzylogic a given binomial opinion satisfies belief  disbelief  uncertainty  1 within a distribution By this method ignorance can be distinguished from probabilistic statements that an agent makes with high confidencelogics logics and circumscription are forms of logic designed to help with default reasoning and the problem Several extensions of logic have been designed to handle specific domains of knowledge such as logics calculus calculus and calculus for representing events and time causal calculus belief calculus and logicsProbabilistic methods for uncertain reasoningMany problems in AI in reasoning planning learning perception and robotics require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information AI researchers have devised a number of powerful tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economicsnetworks are a very general tool that can be used for a large number of problems reasoning using the inference algorithm learning using the algorithm planning using networks and perception using Bayesian networks Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering prediction smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data helping perception systems to analyze processes that occur over time eg Markov models or filtersA key concept from the science of economics is utility a measure of how valuable something is to an intelligent agent Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan using theory analysis information value theory These tools include models such as decision processes dynamic networks theory and design Classifiers and statistical learning methods The simplest AI applications can be divided into two types classifiers if shiny then diamond and controllers if shiny then pick up Controllers do however also classify conditions before inferring actions and therefore classification forms a central part of many AI systems Classifiers are functions that use matching to determine a closest match They can be tuned according to examples making them very attractive for use in AI These examples are known as observations or patterns In supervised learning each pattern belongs to a certain predefined class A class can be seen as a decision that has to be made All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set When a new observation is received that observation is classified based on previous experienceA classifier can be trained in various ways there are many statistical and learning approaches The most widely used classifiers are the neural networkmethods such as the vector machineneighbor algorithmmixture modelBayes classifierand decision treeThe performance of these classifiers have been compared over a wide range of tasks Classifier performance depends greatly on the characteristics of the data to be classified There is no single classifier that works best on all given problems this is also referred to as the no free lunch theorem Determining a suitable classifier for a given problem is still more an art than science Neural networks FileArtificial neural networksvgthumbA neural network is an interconnected group of nodes akin to the vast network of neurons in the brainThe study of neural networks began in the decade before the field AI research was founded in the work of Pitts and McCullough Other important early researchers were Rosenblatt who invented the perceptron and Werbos who developed the backpropagation algorithmThe main categories of networks are acyclic or neural networks where the signal passes in only one direction and neural networks which allow feedback Among the most popular feedforward networks are perceptrons perceptrons and basis networks Among recurrent networks the most famous is the net a form of attractor network which was first described by Hopfield in 1982 Neural networks can be applied to the problem of control for robotics or learning using such techniques as learning and learningtemporal memory is an approach that models some of the structural and algorithmic properties of the neocortex Control theory theory the grandchild of cybernetics has many important applications especially in robotics Languages AI researchers have developed several specialized languages for AI research including Lisp and PrologEvaluating progress In 1950 Alan Turing proposed a general procedure to test the intelligence of an agent now known as the test This procedure allows almost all the major problems of artificial intelligence to be tested However it is a very difficult challenge and at present all agents failArtificial intelligence can also be evaluated on specific problems such as small problems in chemistry handwriting recognition and gameplaying Such tests have been termed matter expert Turing tests Smaller problems provide more achievable goals and there are an everincreasing number of positive resultsThe broad classes of outcome for an AI test are 1 Optimal it is not possible to perform better 2 Strong superhuman performs better than all humans 3 Superhuman performs better than most humans 4 Subhuman performs worse than most humans For example performance at draughts is optimal performance at chess is superhuman and nearing strong superhuman see chessComputers versus humans and performance at many everyday tasks such as recognizing a face or crossing a room without bumping into something is subhumanA quite different approach measures machine intelligence through tests which are developed from mathematical definitions of intelligence Examples of these kinds of tests start in the late nineties devising intelligence tests using notions from complexity and compression Two major advantages of mathematical definitions are their applicability to nonhuman intelligences and their absence of a requirement for human testers Applications FileAutomated online assistantpngthumbAn online assistant providing customer service on a web page  one of many applications of artificial intelligenceArtificial intelligence techniques are pervasive and are too numerous to list  Frequently when a technique reaches mainstream use it is no longer considered artificial intelligence this phenomenon is described as the effect Competitions and prizes There are a number of competitions and prizes to promote research in artificial intelligence The main areas promoted are general machine intelligence conversational behavior datamining driverless cars robot soccer and games Platforms A platform or platform is defined as some sort of hardware architecture or software framework including application frameworks that allows software to run As Rodney BrooksBrooks RA How to build complete creatures rather than isolated cognitive simulators in K VanLehn ed Architectures for Intelligence pp 225239 Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Hillsdale NJ 1991 pointed out many years ago it is not just the artificial intelligence software that defines the AI features of the platform but rather the actual platform itself that affects the AI that results ie we need to be working out AI problems on realworld platforms rather than in isolationA wide variety of platforms has allowed different aspects of AI to develop ranging from systems albeit PCbased but still an entire realworld system to various robot platforms such as the widely available Roomba with open interfaceHacking Roomba  Search Results  atmel Philosophy Artificial intelligence by claiming to be able to recreate the capabilities of the human mind is both a challenge and an inspiration for philosophy Are there limits to how intelligent machines can be Is there an essential difference between human intelligence and artificial intelligence Can a machine have a mind and consciousness A few of the most influential answers to these questions are given belowTurings polite convention If a machine acts as intelligently as a human being then it is as intelligent as a human being Turing theorized that ultimately we can only judge the intelligence of a machine based on its behavior This theory forms the basis of the testThe Dartmouth proposal Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it This conjecture was printed in the proposal for the Dartmouth Conference of 1956 and represents the position of most working AI researchers Newell and Simons physical symbol system hypothesis A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action Newell and Simon argue that intelligences consists of formal operations on symbols Dreyfus argued that on the contrary human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation and on having a feel for the situation rather than explicit symbolic knowledge See critique of AIDreyfus criticized the necessary condition of the symbol system hypothesis which he called the psychological assumption The mind can be viewed as a device operating on bits of information according to formal rules  incompleteness theorem A system such as a computer program can not prove all true statementsThis is a paraphrase of the relevant implication of Gdels theorems Penrose is among those who claim that Gdels theorem limits what machines can do See Emperors New Mind Searles strong AI hypothesis The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds John Searle counters this assertion with his room argument which asks us to look inside the computer and try to find where the mind might be The brain argument The brain can be simulated Moravec Kurzweil and others have argued that it is technologically feasible to copy the brain directly into hardware and software and that such a simulation will be essentially identical to the original Predictions Artificial Intelligence is a common topic in both fiction and projections about the future of technology and society The existence of an artificial intelligence that rivals human intelligence raises difficult ethical issues and the potential power of the technology inspires both hopes and fearsIn fiction Artificial Intelligence has appeared fulfilling many roles includinga servant R2D2 in Warsa law enforcer KITT Knight Ridera comrade Lt Commander Data in Trek The Next Generationa conqueroroverlord Matrixa dictator Folded Handsa benevolent providerde facto ruler Culturean assassin Terminatora sentient race Battlestar GalacticaTransformersan extension to human abilities in the Shelland the savior of the human race Daneel Olivaw in the Robot SeriesShelleys Frankenstein considers a key issue in the of artificial intelligence if a machine can be created that has intelligence could it also feel If it can feel does it have the same rights as a human The idea also appears in modern fiction including the films I Robot Runner and Artificial Intelligence in which humanoid machines have the ability to feel human emotions This issue now known as rights is currently being considered by for example Californias for the Future although many critics believe that the discussion is premature The subject is profoundly discussed in the 2010 documentary film  Prayhttpwwwplugandprayfilmdeencontenthtml Independent documentary Plug  Pray featuring Joseph Weizenbaum and Raymond KurzweilMartin Ford author of The Lights in the Tunnel Automation Accelerating Technology and the Economy of the Future and others argue that specialized artificial intelligence applications robotics and other forms of automation will ultimately result in significant unemployment as machines begin to match and exceed the capability of workers to perform most routine and repetitive jobs Ford predicts that many knowledgebased occupationsand in particular entry level jobswill be increasingly susceptible to automation via expert systems machine learningMachine Learning A Job Killer and other AIenhanced applications AIbased applications may also be used to amplify the capabilities of lowwage offshore workers making it more feasible to outsource knowledge workWeizenbaum wrote that AI applications can not by definition successfully simulate genuine human empathy and that the use of AI technology in fields such as service or psychotherapyIn the early 70s Colby presented a version of Weizenbaums ELIZA known as DOCTOR which he promoted as a serious therapeutic tool  was deeply misguided Weizenbaum was also bothered that AI researchers and some philosophers were willing to view the human mind as nothing more than a computer program a position now known as computationalism To Weizenbaum these points suggest that AI research devalues human lifeMany futurists believe that artificial intelligence will ultimately transcend the limits of progress Kurzweil has used law which describes the relentless exponential improvement in digital technology to calculate that computers will have the same processing power as human brains by the year 2029 He also predicts that by 2045 artificial intelligence will reach a point where it is able to improve itself at a rate that far exceeds anything conceivable in the past a scenario that fiction writer Vinge named the singularityRobot designer Moravec cyberneticist Warwick and inventor Kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines will merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either This idea called transhumanism which has roots in Huxley and Ettinger has been illustrated in fiction as well for example in the manga in the Shell and the sciencefiction series DuneFredkin argues that artificial intelligence is the next stage in evolution an idea first proposed by Samuel Butlers among the Machines 1863 and expanded upon by George Dyson in his book of the

was later discovered to be contaminated with 2378tetrachlorodibenzodioxin an extremely toxic compound It was given its name from the color of the orangestriped 55 US gallon 200 L barrels in which it was shipped and was by far the most widely used of the socalled HerbicidesDuring the Vietnam War between 1962 and 1971 the United States military sprayed nearly  of chemical herbicides and defoliants

isooctyl ester formIOM 1994 p 90Numerous studies have examined health effects linked to Agent Orange its component compounds and its manufacturing byproductsFrumkin 2003 pp245255Prior to the controversy surrounding Agent Orange there was already a large body of scientific evidence linking 245T and 24D to serious negative health effects and ecological damageYoung 2009 p 2 But in 1969 it was revealed to the public that the 245T was contaminated with a dioxin 2378tetrachlorodibenzodioxin TCDD and that the TCDD was causing many of the previously unexplained adverse health effects which were correlated with Agent Orange exposureYoung 2009 p 6 TCDD has been described as perhaps the most toxic molecule ever synthesized by manSchuck 1987 p 18 Internal memoranda revealed Monsanto Corporation a manufacturer of 245T had informed the US government as early as 1952 that 245T was contaminated with a toxic contaminantSchuck 1987 p 17 In the manufacture of 245T accidental overheating of the reaction mixture easily causes the product to condense into the toxic selfcondensation product TCDD At the time precautions were not taken against this unintended side reaction which caused also the disaster in Italy in 1976 In addition to this 245T is hazardous in its own rightIn 1979 the Yale biologist Arthur Galston who specialized in herbicide research published a review of what was known at the time about the toxicity of TCDD Even vanishingly small quantities of dioxin in the diet caused adverse health effects when tested on animals Since then TCDD has been comprehensively studied It has been associated with increased neoplasms in every animal bioassay reported in the scientific literatureDwyer and FleschJanys Editorial Agent Orange in Vietnam Journal of Public Health

2008Early developmentIn 1943 plant biologist Galston began studying the compound acid as a plant growth hormone in an attempt to adapt soybeans to a short growing season Galston found that excessive usage of the compound caused catastrophic defoliation  a finding later used by his colleague Ian Sussex to develop the family of herbicides used in Operation Ranch HandPearce Jeremy Arthur Galston

24D and 245T on cereal grains including rice and broadleaf crops From these studies arose the concept of using aerial applications of herbicides to destroy enemy crops to disrupt their food supply In early 1945 the US army ran tests of various 24D and 245T mixtures at the Army Airfield in Florida which is now listed as a Used Defense Site FUDSYoung 2009 p24Verwey 1977 p 111Use in the Vietnam

areas TCDD concentrations in soil and water were hundreds of times greater than the levels considered safe by the Environmental Protection AgencyThe campaign destroyed  of upland and mangrove forests and millions of acres of crops Overall more than 20 of South Vietnams forests were sprayed at least once over a nine year periodIn 1965 members of the US Congress were told crop destruction is understood to be the more important purpose  but the emphasis is usually given to the jungle defoliation in public mention of the programVerwey 1977 p 113 Soldiers were told they were destroying crops because they were going to be used to feed guerrillas They later discovered nearly all of the food they had been destroying was not being produced for guerrillas it was in reality only being grown to support the local civilian population For example in Quang Ngai province 85 of the crop lands were scheduled to be destroyed in 1970 alone Widespread famine occurred as a result leaving hundreds of thousands of people malnourished or starvingVerwey 1977 p 116The US military began targeting food crops in October 1962 primarily using Blue the American public was not made aware of the crop destruction programs until 1965 and it was then believed that crop spraying had begun that spring In 1965 42 percent of all herbicide spraying was dedicated to food crops The first official acknowledgement of the programs came from the Department in March 1966Many experts at the time including Arthur Galston the biologist who developed and intensively studied TCDD opposed herbicidal warfare due to concerns about the side effects to humans and the environment by indiscriminately spraying the chemical over a wide area As early as 1966 resolutions were introduced to the Nations charging that the US was violating the 1925 Protocol which regulated the use of chemical and biological weaponsSchuck 1987 p 19Effects on the Vietnamese peopleHealth effectsThe Vietnam Red Cross reported as many as 3 million Vietnamese people have been affected by Agent Orange including at least 150000 children born with birth defects According to Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs 48 million Vietnamese people were exposed to Agent Orange resulting in 400000 people being killed or maimed and 500000 children born with birth defectsChildren in the areas where Agent Orange was used have been affected and have multiple health problems including cleft palate mental disabilities hernias and extra fingers and toes In the 1970s high levels of dioxin were found in the milk of South Vietnamese women and in the blood of US soldiers who had served in Vietnam The most affected zones are the mountainous area along Truong Son Long Mountains and the border between Vietnam and Cambodia

and causing illnesses serious skin diseases and a variety of cancers in the lungs larynx and prostateEcological effectsAbout 178 3100000 ha of the total forested area of Vietnam was sprayed during the war which dramatically disrupted ecological equilibrium Furthermore the persistent nature of dioxins erosion caused by loss of protective tree cover and loss of seeding forest stock meant reforestation was difficult or impossible in many areasFurukawa 2004 p 215 Many defoliated forest areas were quickly invaded by aggressive pioneer species such as bamboo and grass which make it unlikely the forests will be able to regenerate Animal species diversity was also significantly impacted in one study a Harvard biologist found 24 species of birds and 5 species of mammals in a sprayed forest while in two adjacent sections of unsprayed forest there were 145 and 170 species of birds and 30 and 55 species of mammalsDioxins from Agent Orange have persisted in the Vietnamese environment since the war settling in the soil and sediment and entering into food chain through the animals and fish that feed in the contaminated areas Movement of dioxins through the web has resulted in bioconcentration and biomagnification The areas most heavily contaminated with dioxins are the sites of former US air basesFurukawa 2004 pp 221222Sociopolitical effectsThe Corporations

conditions the US Veterans Administration has found to be associated with exposure to Agent Orangedioxin and are on the list of conditions eligible for compensation and treatmentMilitary personnel who loaded airplanes and helicopters used in Ranch Hand probably sustained some of the heaviest exposures Members of the Chemical Corps who stored and mixed herbicides and defoliated the perimeters of military bases are also thought to have had some of the heaviest exposures Others with potentially heavy exposures included members of Army Special Forces units who defoliated remote campsites and

Children Political Affairs April 25 2006 After returning home Vietnam veterans began to suspect their ill health or the instances of their wives having miscarriages or children born with birth defects may be related to Agent Orange and the other toxic herbicides to which they were exposed in Vietnam Veterans began to file claims in 1977 to the Department of Veterans Affairs for disability payments for health care for conditions they believed were associated with exposure to Agent Orange or more specifically dioxin but their claims were denied unless they could prove the condition began when they were in the service or within one year of their dischargeBy April 1993 the Department of Veterans Affairs had only compensated 486 victims although it had received disability claims from 39419 soldiers who had been exposed to Agent Orange while serving in VietnamLegal and diplomatic proceedingsUS veterans class action lawsuit against manufacturersSince at least 1978 several lawsuits have been filed against the companies which produced Agent Orange among them Dow Chemical Monsanto and ShamrockMayerson of the firm Mayerson Law Offices PC was an early pioneer in Agent Orange litigation working with renowned environmental attorney Yannacone in 1980 on the first classaction suits against wartime manufacturers of Agent Orange In meeting Dr Ronald A Codario one of the first civilian doctors to see afflicted patients Mayerson so impressed by the fact an MD would show so much interest in a Vietnam veteran forwarded more than a thousand pages of information on Agent Orange and the effects of dioxin on animals and humans to Codarios office the day after he was first contacted by the doctorWilcox 1983  The corporate defendants sought to escape culpability by blaming everything on

Grave In Court Ledger Attorney Hy Mayerson cowrote the brief that certified the Agent Orange Product Liability action as a action the largest ever filed as of its filingCroft Steve Agent Orange CBS Evening News May 7 1980 Hartzs deposition was one of the first ever taken in America and the first for an Agent Orange trial for the purpose of preserving testimony at trial as it was understood that Hartz would not live to see the trial because of the tumor that began to develop while he was a member of Force Forces and LRRPs in VietnamPottstown Mercury The firm also located and supplied critical research to the Veterans lead expert Dr Ronald A Codario MD including about 100 hundred articles from toxicology journals dating back more than a decade as well as data about where herbicides had been sprayed what the effects of dioxin had been on animals and humans and every accident in factories where herbicides were produced or dioxin was a contaminant of some chemical reactionIn 1984 the classaction suit was settled out of court for 180 million slightly over 45 of this was ordered to be paid by Monsanto alone Many veterans who were victims of Agent Orange exposure were outraged the case had been settled instead of going to court and felt they had been betrayed by the lawyers Fairness Hearings were held in five major American cities where veterans and their families discussed their reactions to the settlement and condemned the actions of the lawyers and courts demanding the case be heard before a jury of their peers Federal Judge Julius Weinstein refused the appeals claiming the settlement was fair and just By 1989 the veterans fears were confirmed when it was decided how the money from the settlement would be paid out A totally disabled Vietnam veteran would receive a maximum of 12000 spread out over the course of 10 years Furthermore by accepting the settlement payments disabled veterans would become ineligible for many state benefits that provided far more monetary support than the settlement such as food stamps public assistance and government pensions A widow of a Vietnam veteran who died of Agent Orange exposure would only receive 3700In 2004 Jill Montgomery a spokesperson for Monsanto said Monsanto should not be liable at all for injuries or deaths caused by Agent Orange saying We are sympathetic with people who believe they have been injured and understand their concern to find the cause but reliable scientific evidence indicates that Agent Orange is not the cause of serious longterm health effectsNew Jersey Agent Orange CommissionIn 1980 Jersey created the New Jersey Agent Orange Commission the first state commission created to study its effects The commissions research project in association with University was called The Pointman Project It was disbanded by Governor Todd Whitman in 1996New York Times July 3 1996During Pointman I commission researchers devised ways to determine small dioxin levels in blood Prior to this such levels could only be found in the adipose fat tissue The project compared dioxin levels in a small group of Vietnam veterans who had been exposed to Agent Orange with a group of matched veterans who had not served in Vietnam The results of this project were published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1988Journal of the American Medical Association Vol 259 No 11 March 18 1988The second phase of the project continued to examine and compare dioxin levels in various groups of Vietnam veterans including Army Marines and brown water riverboat Navy personnelUS CongressIn 1991 the US Congress enacted the Orange Act giving the Department of Veterans Affairs the authority to declare certain conditions presumptive to exposure to Agent Orangedioxin making these veterans who served in Vietnam eligible to receive treatment and compensation for these conditionsAgent Orange  Office of Public Health and Environmental Hazards The same law required the National Academy of Sciences to periodically review the science on dioxin and herbicides used in Vietnam to inform the Secretary of Veterans Affairs about the strength of the scientific evidence showing association between exposure to Agent Orangedioxin and certain conditionsPL 1024 and The National Academy of SciencesThrough this process the list of presumptive conditions has grown since 1991 and currently the US Department of Veterans Affairs has listed prostate cancer respiratory cancers multiple myeloma type II diabetes Hodgkins disease nonHodgkins lymphoma soft tissue sarcoma chloracne porphyria cutanea tarda peripheral neuropathy chronic lymphocytic leukemia and spina bifida in children of veterans exposed to Agent Orange as conditions associated with exposure to the herbicide This list now includes B cell leukemias such as hairy cell leukemia Parkinsons disease and ischemic heart disease these last three having been added on August 31 2010 Several highly placed individuals in government are voicing concerns about whether some of the diseases on the list should in fact actually have been includedUSVietnamese government negotiationsIn 2002 Vietnam and the US held a joint conference on Human Health and Environmental Impacts of Agent Orange Following the conference the US Institute of Environmental Health Sciences NIEHS began scientific exchanges between the US and Vietnam and began discussions for a joint research project on the human health impacts of Agent Orange Young 2009 p 310These negotiations broke down in 2005 when neither side could agree on the research protocol and the research project was cancelled More progress has been made on the environmental front In 2005 the first USVietnam workshop on remediation of dioxin was held Young 2009 p 310Starting in 2005 the US Environmental Protection Agency EPA began to work with the Vietnamese government to measure the level of dioxin at the Nang Airbase Also in 2005 the Joint Advisory Committee on Agent Orange made up of representatives of Vietnamese and US government agencies was established The committee has been meeting yearly to explore areas of scientific cooperation technical assistance and environmental remediation of dioxinA breakthrough in the diplomatic stalemate on this issue occurred as a result of United States President George W Bushs state visit to Vietnam in November 2006 In the joint statement President Bush and Triet agreed further joint efforts to address the environmental contamination near former dioxin storage sites would make a valuable

a rights group the Vietnam Association for Victims of Agent Orangedioxin VAVA filed a lawsuit in the States District Court for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn against several US companies for liability in causing personal injury by developing and producing the chemical Dow Chemical and Monsanto were the two largest producers of Agent Orange for the US military and were named in the suit along with the dozens of other companies Diamond Shamrock Uniroyal Thompson Chemicals Hercules etc On March 10 2005 Judge B Weinstein of the Eastern District  who had presided over the 1984 US veterans class action lawsuit  dismissed the lawsuit ruling there was no legal basis for the plaintiffs claims He concluded Agent Orange was not considered a poison under law at the time of its use by the US the US was not prohibited from using it as a herbicide and the companies which produced the substance were not liable for the method of its use by the government The US government was not a party in the lawsuit due to immunity and the court ruled the chemical companies as contractors of the US government shared the same immunity The case was appealed and heard by the Circuit Court of Appeals on June 18 2007 The Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal of the case stating the herbicides used during the war were not intended to be used to poison humans and therefore did not violate international lawFebruary 22 2008 Decision by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals re Vietnam Association of Victims of Agent Orange v Dow Chemical Co The Supreme Court declined to consider the caseThree judges on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan heard the appeal on June 18 2007 They upheld Weinsteins ruling to dismiss the case They ruled that though the herbicides contained a dioxin a known poison they were not intended to be used as a poison on humans Therefore they were not considered a chemical weapon and thus not a violation of international law A further review of the case by the whole panel of judges of the Court of Appeals also confirmed this decision The lawyers for the Vietnamese filed a petition to the US Supreme Court to hear the case On March 2 2009 the Supreme Court denied certiorari and refused to reconsider the ruling of the Court of AppealsIn a November 2004 International poll of 987 people 79 of respondents thought the US chemical companies which produced Agent Orange defoliant should compensate US soldiers who were affected by the toxic chemical used during the war in Vietnam 51 said they supported compensation for Vietnamese Agent

by Agent Orangedioxin the Vietnamese have established peace villages which each host between 50 and 100 victims giving them medical and psychological help As of 2006 there were 11 such villages thus granting some social protection to fewer than a thousand victims US veterans of the war in Vietnam and individuals who are aware and sympathetic to the impacts of Agent Orange have supported these programs in Vietnam An international group of veterans from the US and its allies during the Vietnam War working with their former enemy  veterans from the Vietnam Veterans Association  established the Vietnam Friendship Village outside of HanoiThe center provides medical care rehabilitation and vocational training for children and veterans from Vietnam who have been affected by Agent Orange In 1998 The Red Cross established the Vietnam Agent Orange Victims Fund to provide direct assistance to families throughout Vietnam that have been affected In 2003 the Association of Victims of Agent Orange VAVA was formed In addition to filing the lawsuit against the chemical companies VAVA provides medical care rehabilitation services and financial assistance to those injured by Agent OrangeThe Vietnamese government provides small monthly stipends to more than 200000 Vietnamese believed affected by the herbicides this totaled 408 million in 2008 alone The Vietnam Red Cross has raised more than 22 million to assist the ill or disabled and several US foundations United Nations agencies European governments and nongovernmental organizations have given a total of about 23 million for site

Park in Western AustraliaThe Outback is the vast remote arid area of Australia  term colloquially can refer to any lands outside the main areas The term the outback is generally used to refer to locations that are comparatively more remote than those areas named bushOverviewThe outback is home to a diverse set of animal species such as the kangaroo emu and dingo The Fence was built to restrict dingo movements into agricultural areas towards the south east of the continent The marginally fertile parts are primarily utilised as rangelands and have been traditionally used for sheep or cattle grazing on stations which are leased from the Federal Government While small areas of the outback consist of clay soils the majority has exceedingly infertile palaeosols Riversleigh in Queensland is one of Australias most renowned fossil sites and was recorded as a Heritage site in 1994 The  area contains fossil remains of ancient mammals birds and reptiles of Oligocene and Miocene ageHistoryEarly European exploration of inland Australia was sporadic More focus was on the more accessible and fertile coastal areas The first party to successfully cross the Blue Mountains just outside Sydney was led by Blaxland in 1813 25 years after the colony was established People starting with Oxley in 1817 1818 and 1821 followed by Sturt in 18291830 attempted to follow the westwardflowing rivers to find an inland sea but these were found to all flow into the River and River which turn southOver the period 1858 to 1861 McDouall Stuart led six expeditions north from Adelaide into the outback culminating in successfully reaching the north coast of Australia and returning without the loss of any of the partys members lives This contrasts with the illfated and Wills expedition in 186061 which was much better funded but resulted in the deaths of three of the four members of the transcontinental partyThe Telegraph line was constructed in the 1870s along the route identified by Stuart who had found enough water to support the needed repeater stationsExploration of the outback continued in the 1950s when Beadell explored surveyed and built many roads in support of the nuclear weapons tests at Field and Maralinga and rocket testing on the Prohibited Area Mineral exploration continues as new mineral deposits are identified and developedWhile the early explorers used horses to cross the outback the first woman to make the journey riding a horse was Hingley who rode from Broome to Cairns in 2006First woman conquers OutbackMiningOther than agriculture and tourism the main economic activity in this vast and sparsely settled area is mining Owing to the complete absence of mountain building and glaciation since the Permian in many areas since the Cambrian ages the outback is extremely rich in iron aluminium manganese and uranium ores and also contains major deposits of gold nickel iron lead and zinc ores Because of its size the value of grazing and mining is considerable Major mines and mining areas in the outback include opals at Coober Pedy Lightning Ridge and White Cliffs metals at Broken Hill Tennant Creek Olympic Dam and the remote Mine Oil and gas are extracted in the Basin around MoombaIn Western Australia the diamond mine in the Western Australia is the worlds biggest producer of natural diamonds and contributes approximately onethird of the worlds natural supply The Pilbara regions economy is dominated by mining and petroleum industriesThe Pilbaras oil and gas industry is the regions largest export industry earning 50 billion in 200405 accounting for over 96 of the States production source  WAgovau Most of Australias ore is also mined in the Pilbara and it also has one of the worlds major manganese mines Woodie Woodie Population Owing to the low and erratic rainfall over most of the outback combined with soils which are usually not very fertile inland Australia is relatively sparsely settled More than 90 percent of Australians live in urban areas on the coast However the outback and the history of its exploration and settlement provides Australians with a culturally valued backdrop and stories of swagmen squatters and bushrangers are central to the national ethos The song Matilda which is about a swagman and squatters is probably Australias best internationally known and most wellloved songAboriginal communities in outback regions have not been displaced as they have been in areas of intensive agriculture and large cities in coastal areas So a significant proportion of the countrys indigenous population lives in the OutbackWorld Book Encyclopedia in areas such as the Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara lands in northern South AustraliaMedicineImageOutbackjpgthumbrightFlying over

conventional school to operate Children are educated at home by the of the Air Originally the teachers communicated with the children via radio but now satellite telecommunication is used insteadSome children attend boarding school mostly only those in secondary schoolTerminologyCulturally many urban Australians have had very generalised terms for the otherwise complex range of environments that exist within the inland and tropical regions of the continent Regional terminology can be very specific to specific locations in each mainland stateThe concept of back country which initially meant land beyond the settled regions was in existence in 1800 Crossing of the Blue Mountains and other exploration of the inland however gave a different dimension to the perception The term outback was first used in print in 1869 when the writer clearly meant west of Wagga Wagga New South WalesCoupe Sheena ed  Frontier Country Vol 1 Weldon Russell Publishing Willoughby 1989 ISBN 1 875202 01 3It is colloquially said that the outback is located beyond the Stump The location of the black stump may be some hypothetical location or may vary depending on local custom and folklore It has been suggested that the term comes from the Black Stump Wine Saloon that once stood about 10 kilometres out of New South Wales on the Gunnedah Road It is claimed that the saloon named after the nearby Black Stump Run and Black Stump Creek was an important staging post for traffic to northwest New South Wales and it became a marker by which people gauged their journeysImageWest MacDonnell National ParkJPGthumbleftThe MacDonnell Ranges in the Territory are found in the centre of the countryThe NeverNever is a term referring to remoter parts of the Australian outback The outback can be also referred to as back of beyond  back o Bourke although these terms are more frequently used when referring to something a long way from anywhere or a long way away The wellwatered north of the continent is often called the End and the arid interior The Red Centre owing to its vast amounts of red soil and sparse greenery amongst its landscapeWildlifethumb100pxrightA Brumby in the OutbackThe Australian Outback is full of very welladapted wildlife although much of it may not be immediately visible to the casual observer  Many animals such as kangaroos and dingoes hide in bushes to rest and keep cool during the heat of the dayBirdlife is prolific most often seen at waterholes at dawn and dusk  Huge flocks of budgerigars cockatoos corellas and galahs are often sighted On bare ground or roads during the winter various species of snakes and lizards bask in the sun but they are rarely seen during the summer monthsFeral animals such as camels thrive in central Australia brought to Australia by the early Afghan drivers Feral horses known as brumbies are station horses that have run wild  Feral pigs foxes cats and rabbits are also imported animals that degrade the environment so

RegionVisitors to the outback often drive their own or rented vehicles or take organised tours Travel through remote areas on main roads is easily done and requires no planning  However travel through very remote areas on isolated tracks requires planning and a suitable reliable vehicle usually a drive On very remote routes considerable supplies and equipment may be required this can include prearranged caches It is not advisable to travel into these especially remote areas with a single vehicle unless fully equipped with good communication technology eg a satellite phone EPIRB etc  Many visitors prefer to travel in these areas in a convoy Deaths from tourists and locals becoming stranded on outback trips occasionally occur sometime because insufficient water and food supplies were taken or because people have walked away from their vehicle in search of help  Travellers through very remote areas should always inform a reliable person of their route and expected destination arrival time and remember that a vehicle is much easier to locate in an aerial search than a person so in the event of a breakdown they must not leave their vehicleTransportthumbrightA road sign warning of potentially dangerous conditions aheadThe outback is crisscrossed by historic tracks Most of the major highways have an excellent bitumen surface and other major roads are usually wellmaintained dirt roads  Tracks in very sandy or exceedingly rocky areas may require highclearance four wheel drives and spare fuel tyres food and water before attempting to travel them however most outback roads are easily traversed in ordinary vehicles provided care is taken  Drivers unused to dirt roads should be especially cautious  it is recommended that drivers reduce their speed drive with extra care and avoid driving at night because animals can stray on to roads  Travelling in remote areas in northern Australia is not advisable during the wet season November to April as heavy tropical downpours can quickly make dirt roads impassable In the remotest parts of Australia fuel sellers are located hundreds of kilometres apart so spare fuel must be carried or refuelling spots calculated carefully in order not to run out of fuel in between towns In addition multiple trailer trucks known as Road Trains traverse these roads and extreme care must be taken when around these vehicles due to their weight length often three full trailers long and amount of dust thrown up by 46 tyresThe Highway runs from north to south through the centre of the continent roughly paralleled by the railway There is a proposal to develop some of the roads running from the SW to the NE to create an allweather road named the Highway crossing the continent diagonally from Western Australia north of Kalgoorlie through the Northern Territory to Winton in QueenslandAir transport is relied on for mail delivery in some areas owing to sparse settlement and wetseason road closures  Most outback mines have an airstrip and many have a flyout workforce Most outback stations and stations have an airstrip and quite a few have their own light plane Medical and ambulance services are provided by the

tree Adansonia digitataBotswana is currently facing two major environmental problems drought and desertification  The desertification problems predominantly stem from the severe times of drought in the country  Due to the drought 75 of the countrys human and animal populations are dependent on groundwater  Groundwater use has eased the effects of drought but has left a toll on the land Groundwater is retrieved through drilling deep boreholes which leads to the erosion of the land  Surface water is very scarce in Botswana and less than 5 of the agriculture in the country is sustainable by rainfall  Due to this 95 of the country raises cattle and livestock as a means for an income  Therefore it is not a surprise to see that 71 of the countrys land is used for communal grazing which has been a major cause for the desertification of the countrySince raising livestock has proven to be profitable for the people of Botswana the land is continuing to be exploited The animal populations have continued to dramatically increase From 1966 to 1991 the livestock population has increased from 17 million to 55 million  Similarly the human population has increased from 574000 in 1971 to 15 million in 1995 nearly a 200 increase  Over 50 of all households in Botswana own cattle which is presently the largest single source of rural income  Rangeland degradation or desertification is regarded as the reduction in land productivity as a result of overstocking and overgrazing or as a result of veld product gathering for commercial use  Degradation is exacerbated by the effects of drought and climate change  It has been reported that the Delta is drying up due to the increased grazing of livestock The Okavango Delta is one of the major semiforested wetlands in Botswana the largest inland delta in the world and is a crucial ecosystem to the survival of many animalsThe Department and Forestry and Range Resources has already begun to implement project to reintroduce indigenous vegetation into communities in Kgalagadi South Kweneng North and Boteti Reintroduction of indigenous vegetation will help with the degradation of the land The States Government has also entered into an agreement with Botswana giving them 7 million US dollars to reduce Botswanas debt by 83 million US dollars  The stipulation of the US reducing Botswanas debt is that Botswana will focus on more extensive conservation of the landThe Nations Development Programme claims that a major problem behind the overexploitation of resources including land in Botswana is due to the poverty level  To help change this the UNDP joined in with a project started in the southern community of Struizendam in Botswana  The purpose of the project is to draw from indigenous knowledge and traditional land management systems  The leaders of this movement are supposed to be the people in the community in order to draw these in in turn increasing their possibilities to earn an income and thus decreasing poverty  The UNDP also stated that the government has to effectively implement policies to allow people to manage their own local resources and are giving the government information to help with policy developmentDefenceAt the time of independence Botswana had no armed forces It was only after attacks from the Rhodesian and South African armies that the Defence Force BDF was formed

4482	Liberal Party UK colours  Yellow historically orange and before that greenThe Liberal Party was one of the two major political parties of the Kingdom during the 19th and early 20th centuries It was a third party of negligible importance throughout the latter half of the 20th Century before merging with the Social Democratic Party SDP in 1988 to form the present day Democrats The party was generally considered to be on the centreleft of the political spectrum and advocated liberalismIt grew out of the Whig Party in 1859 and Gladstone carried the party through governments in the late 19th century The party split over the issue of Irish Home Rule but returned to power in 1906 through a landslide victory During this time in government the Liberals are credited with the socalled Liberal Reforms which saw the creation of a basic state During World War I the Liberals governed Britain through a coalition with the Conservatives which ended in 1922 In the 1920s the Labour Party permanently replaced the Liberals as Britains main centreleft party and the Liberals went into decline which culminated in them winning as few as 6 seats at general elections during the 1950s A comeback of sorts was seen during the 1960s and 1970s but it was not until 1981 when the Liberals allied with the newly formed SDP to form the Alliance that the party enjoyed significant electoral success In the 1983 general election the alliance took 25 of the popular vote but this only translated into 23 seats During 1988 the Liberals formally merged with the SDP to form the Liberal Democrats though a small splinter Liberal Party was formed in 1989 by former members opposed to the mergerIdeologyDuring the 19th century the Liberal Party was broadly in favour of what would today be called liberalism supporting laissezfaire economic policies such as trade and minimal government interference in the economy this doctrine was usually termed Liberalism after the era Liberal Prime Minister Ewart Gladstone The Liberal Party favoured social reform personal liberty reducing the powers of Crown and the of England many of them were Nonconformists and an extension of the electoral franchise Sir William Harcourt a prominent Liberal politician in the Victorian era said this about liberalism in 1872FileLeeds Town Hall General Election resultsjpgthumbrightA crowd waits outside Town Hall to see them elect a Liberal Party candidate during the 1880 general electionsIf there be any party which is more pledged than another to resist a policy of restrictive legislation having for its object social coercion that party is the Liberal party Cheers But liberty does not consist in making others do what you think right Hear hear The difference between a free Government and a Government which is not free is principally thisthat a Government which is not free interferes with everything it can and a free Government interferes with nothing except what it must A despotic Government tries to make everybody do what it wishes a Liberal Government tries as far as the safety of society will permit to allow everybody to do as he wishes It has been the tradition of the Liberal party consistently to maintain the doctrine of individual liberty It is because they have done so that England is the place where people can do more what they please than in any other country in the worldIt is this practice of allowing one set of people to dictate to another set of people what they shall do what they shall think what they shall drink when they shall go to bed what they shall buy and where they shall buy it what wages they shall get and how they shall spend them against which the Liberal party have always protestedThe Times 31 December 1872 p 5The political terms of modern progressive or new Liberalism began to appear in the mid to late 1880s and became increasingly common to denote the tendency in the Liberal Party to favour an increased role for the state as more important than the classical liberal stress on selfhelp and freedom of choiceW H Greenleaf The British Political Tradition Volume II The Ideological Heritage London Methuen 1983 p 143By the early 20th century the Liberals stance began to shift towards New Liberalism what would today be called liberalism a belief in personal liberty with a support for government intervention to provide minimum levels of welfare This shift was best exemplified by the Liberal government of Henry Asquith and his Chancellor Lloyd George whose reforms in the early 1900s created a basic stateDavid Lloyd George adopted a programme at the 1929 general election entitled We Can Conquer Unemployment although by this stage the Liberals had declined to thirdparty status The Liberals now as expressed in the Liberal Yellow Book regarded opposition to state intervention as being a characteristic of rightwing extremistsLiberal Industrial Inquiry Britains Industrial Future London 1928 p 453After nearly becoming extinct in the 1940s and 50s the Liberal Party revived its fortunes somewhat under the leadership of Grimond in the 1960s by positioning itself as a radical centrist nonsocialist alternative to the Conservative and Labour Party governments of the timeOriginsthumbleftViscount PalmerstonThe Liberal Party grew out of the Whigs which had its origins as an aristocratic faction in the reign of Charles II The Whigs were in favour of reducing the power of The Crown and increasing the power of the Parliament Although their motives in this were originally to gain more power for themselves the more idealistic Whigs gradually came to support an expansion of democracy for its own sake The great figures of reformist Whiggery were James Fox died 1806 and his disciple and successor Earl Grey After decades in opposition the Whigs came to power under Grey in 1830 and carried the First Reform Act in 1832The Reform Act was the climax of Whiggery but also brought about the Whigs demise The admission of the middle classes to the franchise and to the House of Commons led eventually to the development of a systematic class liberalism and the end of Whiggery although for many years reforming aristocrats held senior positions in the party In the years after Greys retirement the party was led first by Lord Melbourne a fairly traditional Whig and then by Lord John Russell the son of a Duke but a crusading radical and Lord Palmerston a renegade Irish Tory and essentially a conservative although capable of radical gesturesAs early as 1839 Russell had adopted the name Liberal Party but in reality the party was a loose coalition of Whigs in the of Lords and Radicals in the Commons The leading Radicals were Bright and Cobden who represented the manufacturing towns that had gained representation under the Reform Act They favoured social reform personal liberty reducing the powers of the Crown and the of England many of them were Nonconformists avoidance of war and foreign alliances which were bad for business and above all trade For a century free trade was the one cause which could unite all LiberalsIn 1841 the Liberals lost office to the Conservative Party under Sir Peel but their period in opposition was short because the Conservatives split over the repeal of the Laws a free trade issue and a faction known as the Peelites but not Peel himself who died soon after defected to the Liberal side This allowed ministries led by Russell Palmerston and the Peelite Lord Aberdeen to hold office for most of the 1850s and 1860s The leading Peelite was Ewart Gladstone who was a zealous reforming of the Exchequer in most of these governments The formal foundation of the Liberal Party is traditionally traced to 1859 and the formation of Palmerstons second governmentThe WhigRadical amalgam could not become a true modern political party however while it was dominated by aristocrats and it was not until the departure of the Two Terrible Old Men Russell and Palmerston that Gladstone could become the first leader of the modern Liberal Party This was brought about by Palmerstons death in 1865 and Russells retirement in 1868 After a brief Conservative interlude during which the Second Reform Act was passed by agreement between the parties Gladstone won a huge victory at the 1868 election and formed the first Liberal government The establishment of the party as a national membership organisation came with the foundation of the Liberal Federation in 1877The Gladstonian erathumbrightWilliam GladstoneFor the next thirty years Gladstone and Liberalism were synonymous The Grand Old Man as he became known was Minister of the United Kingdom four times and the powerful flow of his rhetoric dominated British politics even when he was out of office His rivalry with the Conservative leader Disraeli became legendary Gladstone was a Church Anglican and enjoyed the company of aristocrats but he grew ever more progressive as he grew older he was as one wit put it a Tory in all but essentials Queen Victoria who had grown up as a Whig supporter under the tutelage of Melbourne became a Conservative in reaction to Gladstones moralising LiberalismGladstones great achievements in office were his reforms to education land reform particularly in Ireland where he ended centuries of landlord oppression the disestablishment of the Anglican of Ireland through the Church Act 1869 the introduction of democratic local government reform allowing the ballot the Act 1872 and removing electoral corruption the abolition of patronage in the civil service and the army and the Third Reform Act which greatly extended the vote to almost all adult males Gladstones reforming tendencies were borne partly out of his visit to Lancashire during The Cotton Famine where he was impressed by class qualities It was during the 1860s that Gladstone became known as The Peoples WilliamIn foreign policy Gladstone was in general against foreign entanglements but did not resist the reality of imperialism For example he approved of the occupation of Egypt by British forces in 1882In the 1874 general election Gladstone was defeated by the Conservatives under Disraeli during a sharp recession He formally resigned as Liberal leader and was succeeded by the Marquess of Hartington but he soon changed his mind and returned to active politics He strongly disagreed with Disraelis proOttoman foreign policy and in 1880 he conducted the first outdoor masselection campaign in Britain known as the campaign The Liberals won a large majority in the 1880 election Hartington ceded his place and Gladstone resumed officeAmong the consequences of the Reform Act 188485 was the giving of the vote to the Catholic peasants in Ireland and the consequent creation of an Parliamentary Party led by Stewart Parnell In the 1885 general election this party won the balance of power in the House of Commons and demanded Home Rule as the price of support for a continued Gladstone ministry Gladstone personally supported Home Rule but a strong Unionist faction led by Chamberlain along with the last of the Whigs Hartington opposed itThe result was a catastrophic split in the Liberal Party and heavy defeat in the 1886 election at the hands of Lord Salisbury There was a final weak Gladstone ministry in 1892 but it also was dependent on Irish support and failed to get Irish Home Rule through the House of Lords Gladstone finally retired in 1894 and his ineffectual successor Lord Rosebery led the party to another heavy defeat in the 1895 general electionAnother consequence of the Third Reform Act was the rise of LibLab candidates in the absence of any committed Labour Party The Act split all county constituencies which were represented by multiple MPs in to singlemember constituencies roughly corresponding to population patterns In areas with working class majorities in particular coalmining areas LibLab candidates were popular and they received sponsorship and endorsement from unions In the first election after the Act was passed 1885 thirteen were elected up from two in 1874 The Third Reform Act also facilitated the demise of the Whig old guard in twomember constituencies it was common to pair a Whig and a radical under the Liberal banner After the Third Reform Act fewer Whigs were selected as candidatesThe

Harcourt and Morley to resign their positions in 1898 as they continued to be at loggerheads with Rosebery over Irish home rule and issues relating to imperialism Replacing Harcourt as party leader was Sir CampbellBannerman Harcourts resignation briefly muted the turmoil in the party but the beginning of the Boer War soon nearly broke the party apart with Rosebery and a circle of supporters including important future Liberal leaders HH Asquith Edward Grey and Richard Burdon Haldane forming a clique dubbed the Liberal Imperialists that supported the government in the prosecution of the war On the other side more radical members of the party formed a ProBoer faction that denounced the conflict and called for an immediate end to hostilities Quickly rising to prominence among the ProBoers was David Lloyd George a relatively new MP and a master of rhetoric who took advantage of having a national stage to speak out on a controversial issue to make his name in the party Harcourt and Morley also sided with this group though with slightly different aims CampbellBannerman tried to keep these forces together at the head of a moderate Liberal rump but in 1901 he delivered a speech on the governments methods of barbarism in South Africa that pulled him further to the left and nearly tore the party in two The party was saved after Salisburys retirement in 1902 when his successor Arthur Balfour pushed a series of unpopular initiatives such as a new education bill and Joseph Chamberlain called for a new system of protectionist tariffs CampbellBannerman was able to rally the party around the traditional liberal platform of free trade and land reform and led them to the greatest election victory in their history This would prove the last time the Liberals won a majority in their own rightAlthough he presided over a large majority Sir Henry CampbellBannerman was overshadowed by his ministers most notably Henry Asquith at the Exchequer Grey at the Foreign Office Richard Burdon Haldane at the War Office and Lloyd George at the Board of Trade An ill CampbellBannerman retired in 1908 and died later that year He was succeeded by Asquith who stepped up the governments radicalism Lloyd George succeeded Asquith at the Exchequer and was in turn succeeded at the Board of Trade by Churchill a recent defector from the ConservativesThe Liberals pushed through much legislation including the regulation of working hours Insurance and welfare It was at this time that a political battle over the socalled Budget resulted in the passage of an act ending the power of the of Lords to block legislation The cost was high however as the government was required by the king to call two general elections in 1910 to validate its position and ended up frittering away most of its large majority being left once again dependent on the Irish NationalistsAs a result Asquith was forced to introduce a new third Home Rule bill in 1912 Since the House of Lords no longer had the power to block the bill the Unionists Volunteers led by Sir Carson launched a campaign of opposition that included the threat of armed resistance in Ulster and the threat of mutiny by army officers in Ireland in 1914 see Incident In their resistance to Home Rule the Ulster Protestants had the full support of the Conservatives whose leader Andrew Bonar Law was of UlsterScots descent The country seemed to be on the brink of civil war when War I broke out in August 1914The war struck at the heart of everything British Liberals believed in The party became divided over the distinctly illiberal policies that were introduced under her auspices including conscription and the Defence of the Realm Act Several Cabinet ministers resigned and Asquith the master of domestic politics proved a poor war leader Lloyd George and Churchill however were zealous supporters of the war and gradually forced the old pacifist Liberals out The poor British performance in the early months of the war forced Asquith to invite the Conservatives into a coalition on 17 May 1915 This marked the end of the last allLiberal government This coalition fell apart at the end of 1916 when the Conservatives withdrew their support from Asquith and gave it to Lloyd George instead who became Prime Minister at the head of a coalition government largely made up of Conservatives Asquith and his followers moved to the opposition benches in Parliament and the Liberal Party was split once againLiberal declineImageDavid Lloyd GeorgejpgthumbrightLloyd GeorgeIn the 1918 general election Lloyd George the Man Who Won the War led his coalition into another election and won a sweeping victory over the Asquithian Liberals and the newly emerging Labour Party Lloyd George and the Conservative leader Andrew Bonar Law wrote a joint letter of support to candidates to indicate they were considered the official Coalition candidates  this coupon as it became known was issued against many sitting Liberal MPs often to devastating effect though not against Asquith himself Asquith and most of his colleagues lost their seats Lloyd George still claimed to be leading a Liberal government but he was increasingly under the influence of the rejuvenated Conservative party In 1922 the Conservative backbenchers rebelled against the continuation of the coalition citing in particular the Crisis over Turkey and Lloyd Georges corrupt sale of honours amongst other grievances and Lloyd George was forced to resign The Conservatives came back to power under Bonar Law and then BaldwinAt the 1922 and 1923 elections the Liberals won barely a third of the vote and only a quarter of the seats in the House of Commons as many radical voters abandoned the divided Liberals and went over to Labour In 1922 Labour became the official opposition A reunion of the two warring factions took place in 1923 when the new Conservative Prime Minister Baldwin committed his party to protective tariffs causing the Liberals to reunite in support of free trade The party gained ground in the 1923 general election but ominously made most of its gains from Conservatives whilst losing ground to Labour  a sign of the partys direction for many years to come The party remained the third largest in the House of Commons but the Conservatives had lost their majority There was much speculation and fear about the prospect of a Labour government and comparatively little about a Liberal government even though it could have plausibly presented an experienced team of ministers compared to Labours almost complete lack of experience as well as offering a middle ground that could get support from both Conservatives and Labour in crucial Commons divisions But instead of trying to force the opportunity to form a Liberal government Asquith decided instead to allow Labour the chance of office in the belief that they would prove incompetent and this would set the stage for a revival of Liberal fortunes at Labours expense It was a fatal errorImageUK popular votesvgthumb300pxleftShare of the vote received by Conservatives blue WhigsLiberalsLiberal Democrats orange Labour red and others grey in general elections since 1832Table

Following success as the successor to the Whig party the partys share of the popular vote plummeted after the First World War as it lost votes to the new Labour party and fractured into groups such as the National and Coalition LiberalsLabour was determined to destroy the Liberals and become the sole party of the left  MacDonald was forced into a snap election in 1924 and although his government was defeated he achieved his objective of virtually wiping the Liberals out as many more radical voters now moved to Labour whilst moderate middleclass Liberal voters concerned about socialism moved to the Conservatives The Liberals were reduced to a mere forty seats in Parliament only seven of which had been won against candidates from both parties and none of these formed a coherent area of Liberal survival The party seemed finished and during this period some Liberals such as Churchill went over to the Conservatives while others went over to Labour Several Labour ministers of later generations such as Foot and Benn were the sons of Liberal MPsAsquith died in 1928 and the enigmatic figure of Lloyd George returned to the leadership and began a drive to produce coherent policies on many key issues of the day In the 1929 general election he made a final bid to return the Liberals to the political mainstream with an ambitious programme of state stimulation of the economy called We Can Conquer Unemployment largely written for him by the Liberal economist Maynard Keynes The Liberals gained ground but once again it was at the Conservatives expense whilst also losing seats to Labour Indeed the urban areas of the country suffering heavily from unemployment which might have been expected to respond the most to the radical economic policies of the Liberals instead gave the party its worst results By contrast most of the partys seats were won either due to the absence of a candidate from one of the other parties or in rural areas on the fringe where local evidence suggests that economic ideas were at best peripheral to the electorates concerns The Liberals now found themselves with 59 members holding the balance of power in a Parliament where Labour was the largest party but lacked an overall majority Lloyd George offered a degree of support to the Labour government in the hope of winning concessions including a degree of electoral reform to introduce the vote but this support was to prove bitterly divisive as the Liberals increasingly divided between those seeking to gain what Liberal goals they could achieve those who preferred a Conservative government to a Labour one and viceversaThe last majority Liberal Government in Britain was elected in 1906 The preWorld War I period in Britain was a period of worker strikes and civil unrest involving many violent confrontations between the policetroops and civilians Other issues of the period included the suffragettes and the Irish Independence movementAfter the carnage of 19141918 the democratic reform of the of the People Act 1918 instantly tripled the number of people allowed to vote in Britain from 7 to 21 million The Labour Party benefited the most from this huge change in the British electorate forming its first minority government in 1924The splits over the National Governmentthumb140pxHerbert SamuelIn 1931 MacDonalds government fell apart under the Great Depression and the Liberals agreed to join his National Government dominated by the Conservatives Lloyd George himself was ill and did not actually join Soon however the Liberals faced another divisive crisis when a National Government was proposed to fight the 1931 general election with a mandate for tariffs From the outside Lloyd George called for the party to abandon the government completely in defence of free trade but only a few MPs and candidates followed Another group under Sir John Simon then emerged who were prepared to continue their support for the government and take the Liberal places in the Cabinet if there were resignations The third group under Sir Herbert Samuel pressed for the parties in government to fight the election on separate platforms In doing so the bulk of Liberals remained supporting the government but two distinct Liberal groups had emerged within this bulk  the Liberal Nationals officially the National Liberals after 1947 led by Simon also known as Simonites and the Samuelites or official Liberals led by Samuel who remained as the official party Both groups secured about 34 MPs but proceeded to diverge even further after the election with the Liberal Nationals remaining supporters of the government throughout its life There were to be a succession of discussions about them rejoining the Liberals but these usually foundered on the issues of free trade and continued support for the National Government The one significant reunification came in 1946 when the Liberal and Liberal National party organisations in London mergedThe official Liberals found themselves a tiny minority within a government committed to protectionism Slowly they found this issue to be one they could not support In early 1932 it was agreed to suspend the principle of collective responsibility to allow the Liberals to oppose the introduction of tariffs Later in 1932 the Liberals resigned their ministerial posts over the introduction of the Ottawa Agreement on Preference However they remained sitting on the government benches supporting it in Parliament though in the country local Liberal activists bitterly opposed the government Finally in late 1933 the Liberals crossed the floor of the House of Commons and went into complete opposition By this point their number of MPs was severely depleted In the 1935 general election just 17 Liberal MPs were elected along with Lloyd George and three followers as independent Liberals Immediately after the election the two groups reunited though Lloyd George declined to play much of a formal role in his old party Over the next ten years there would be further defections as MPs deserted to either the Liberal Nationals or Labour Yet there were a few recruits such as Davies who had deserted to the National Liberals in 1931 but now returned to the party during the War II and who would lead it after the warNear extinctionSamuel had lost his seat in the 1935 election and the leadership of the party fell to Sir Archibald Sinclair With many traditional domestic Liberal policies now regarded as irrelevant he focused the party on opposition to both the rise of Fascism in Europe and the appeasement foreign policy of the British government arguing that intervention was needed in contrast to the Labour calls for pacifism Despite the partys weaknesses Sinclair gained a high profile as he sought to recall the Campaign and once more revitalise the Liberals as the party of a strong foreign policyIn 1940 they joined Churchills wartime coalition government with Sinclair serving as of State for Air the last British Liberal to hold Cabinet rank office for seventy years However it was a sign of the partys lack of importance that they were not included in the Cabinet At the 1945 general election Sinclair and many of his colleagues lost their seats to both Conservatives and Labour By 1951 there were only six MPs all but one of them were aided by the fact that the Conservatives refrained from fielding candidates in those constituencies In 1957 this total fell to five when one of the Liberal MPs died and the subsequent byelection was lost to the Labour Party which selected the former Liberal Deputy Leader Lady Megan Lloyd George as its own candidate The Liberal Party seemed close to extinction During this low period it was often joked that Liberal MPs could hold meetings in the back of one taxiLiberal revivalThrough the 1950s and into the 1960s the Liberals survived only because a handful of constituencies in rural Scotland and Wales clung to their Liberal traditions whilst in two English towns Bolton and Huddersfield local Liberals and Conservatives agreed to each contest only one of the towns two seats Grimond for example who became Liberal leader in 1956 was MP for the remote Orkney and Shetland islands Under his leadership a Liberal revival began marked by the Orpington byelection of March 1962 which was won by Eric Lubbock There  the Liberals won a seat in the London suburbs for the first time since 1935The Liberals became the first of the major British political parties to advocate British membership of the Economic Community Grimond also sought an intellectual revival of the party seeking to position it as a nonsocialist radical alternative to the Conservative government of the day In particular he canvassed the support of the young postwar university students and recent graduates appealing to younger voters in a way that many of his recent predecessors had not and asserting a new strand of Liberalism for the postwar worldThe new middleclass suburban generation began to find the Liberals policies attractive again Under Grimond who retired in 1967 and his successor Thorpe the Liberals regained the status of a serious third force in British politics polling up to 20 of the vote but unable to break the duopoly of Labour and Conservative and win more than fourteen seats in the Commons An additional problem was competition in the Liberal heartlands in Scotland and Wales from the National Party and Cymru who both grew as electoral forces from the 1960s onwards Although Hooson held on to the seat of Montgomeryshire upon Davies death in 1962 the party lost its other Welsh five Welsh seats between 1950 and 1966 In September 1966 the Liberal Party formed their own state party moving the Liberal Party into a fully federal structureRussell Deacon 2011 History of the Welsh Liberal party Welsh Academic Press In local elections Liverpool remained a Liberal stronghold with the party taking the plurality of seats on the elections to the new Liverpool Metropolitan Borough Council in 1973 In the February 1974 general election the Conservative government of Heath won a plurality of votes cast but the Labour Party gained a plurality of seats due to the Ulster Unionist MPs refusing to support the Conservatives after the Northern Ireland Agreement The Liberals now held the balance of power in the Commons Conservatives offered Thorpe the Office if he would join a coalition government with Heath Thorpe was personally in favour of it but the party insisted on a clear government commitment to introducing representation and a change of Prime Minister The former was unacceptable to Heaths Cabinet and the latter to Heath personally so the talks collapsed Instead a minority Labour government was formed under Wilson but with no formal support from Thorpe In the October 1974 general election the Liberals slipped back slightly and the Labour government won a waferthin majorityThorpe was subsequently forced to resign after allegations about his private life The partys new leader Steel negotiated the pact with Wilsons successor as Prime Minister Callaghan According to this pact the Liberals would support the government in crucial votes in exchange for some influence over policy The agreement lasted from 1977 to 1978 but proved mostly fruitless for two reasons the Liberals key demand of representation was rejected by most Labour MPs whilst the contacts between Liberal spokespersons and Labour ministers often proved detrimental such as between finance spokesperson Pardoe and of the Exchequer Healey who were mutually antagonisticAlliance with Social DemocratsWhen the Labour government fell in 1979 the Conservatives under Thatcher won a victory which served to push the Liberals back into the margins In 1981 defectors from the moderate wing of the Labour Party led by former Cabinet ministers Jenkins Owen and Williams founded the Social Democratic Party The new party and the Liberals quickly formed an alliance which briefly topped the opinion polls before being overtaken by the Tories and fought the 1983 and 1987 general elections jointly as the Alliance During 1982 and 1983 at the depths of Labours fortunes under Foot there was much talk of the Alliance becoming the dominant party of the left and even of Jenkins becoming Prime Minister In fact while the Alliance won over 20 of the vote each time it was still a long way behind Labour in terms of seats and as a result was disbanded after the 1987 election with the two parties merging the following year to form the Social and Liberal Democrats who a year after that become the Liberal DemocratsMerger with Social DemocratsIn 1988 the Liberals and Social Democrats merged to create what came to be called the Liberal Democrats Over twothirds of the members and all the serving MPs of the Liberal Party joined this party led first jointly by Steel and the SDP leader Robert Maclennan and later by Ashdown 198899 Kennedy 19992006 Menzies Campbell 200607 and Clegg incumbentThough the merger process was traumatic and the new party suffered a few years of extremely poor poll results it gradually found much greater electoral success than the Liberal Party had done in the postwar era In the 2005 general election the Liberal Democrats elected 62 MPs to the House of Commons a far cry from the days when the Liberals had just 5 MPs and Liberalism as a political force had seemed moribundAs was the case with the Liberal Party for most of the 20th century the Liberal Democrats face constant questioning about which of the other two parties they are closer to in particular about which they would support in the event of a parliament The party is keen to maintain its independent identity however and argues that the need for a modern Liberal force in British politics has never been greaterIn the 2010 General Election the Conservative Party won more seats than any other but not enough to form a majority government After several days of negotiation the Liberal Democrats agreed to join the Conservatives as part of a coalition governmentThe post1988 Liberal PartyA group of Liberal opponents of the merger with the Social Democrats including Meadowcroft formerly Liberal MP for Leeds West and Paul Wiggin who served on Peterborough City Council as a Liberal continued under the old name of the Liberal Party This was legally a new organisation the headquarters records assets and debts of the old party were inherited by the Liberal Democrats but its constitution asserts it to be the same

crystals are relatively rare Pure beryl is colorless but it is frequently tinted by impurities possible colors are green blue yellow red and whiteEtymologyThe name beryl is derived via Latin beryllus French beryl and English beril from Greek  beryllos which referred to a precious bluegreen colorofseawater stone and originated from Prakrit veruliya  and Pali veuriya  veiru  or viar  to become pale ultimately from Sanskrit  vaidurya which is of Dravidian origin maybe from the name of BelurBeryl Online Etymology Dictionary Retrieved on 20110419 The term was later adopted for the mineral beryl more exclusively The Late Latin word berillus was abbreviated as brill which produced the Italian word brillare meaning shine the French word brille meaning shine and the English word brilliancethe

from Russia The gemgravel placer deposits of Lanka contain aquamarine Clear yellow beryl such as that occurring in Brazil is sometimes called aquamarine chrysolite When corundum presents the bluish tint of typical aquamarine it is often termed Oriental aquamarine The deep blue version of aquamarine is called maxixe Its color fades to white when exposed to sunlight or is subjected to heat treatment though the color returns with irradiation The pale blue color of aquamarine is attributed to Fe2 The Fe3 ions produce goldenyellow color and when both Fe2 and Fe3 are present the color is a darker blue as in maxixe Decoloration of maxixe by light or heat thus may be due to the charge transfer Fe3 and Fe2 Darkblue maxixe color can be produced in green pink or yellow beryl by irradiating it with highenergy particles rays neutrons or even Xrays In the States aquamarines can be found at the summit of Mt Antero in the Range in central Colorado In Wyoming aquamarine has been discovered in the Horn Mountains near River Pass In Brazil there are mines in the states of Gerais Santo and Bahia and minorly in Grande do Norte The Mines of Colombia Zambia Madagascar Malawi Tanzania and Kenya also produce aquamarineThe largest aquamarine of gemstone quality ever mined was found in Marambaia Minas Gerais Brazil in 1910 It weighed over 110 kg and its dimensions were  long and  in diameterEmeraldEmerald refers to green beryl colored by trace amounts of chromium and sometimes vanadium The word emerald comes via English Emeraude imported from French smeraude and Latin Esmaraldus from Latin smaragdus from Greek smaragdos   green gem its original source being a Semitic word izmargad  or the Sanskrit word marakata  meaning green Most emeralds are highly included so their brittleness resistance to breakage is classified as generally poor Emeralds in antiquity were mined by the Egyptians and in Austria as well as Swat in northern Pakistan A rare type of emerald known as a trapiche emerald is occasionally found in the mines of Colombia A trapiche emerald exhibits a star pattern it has raylike spokes of dark carbon impurities that give the emerald a sixpointed radial pattern It is named for the trapiche a grinding wheel used to process sugarcane in the region Colombian emeralds are generally the most prized due to their transparency and fire Some of the most rare emeralds come from three main emerald mining areas in Colombia Muzo Coscuez and Chivor Fine emeralds are also found in other countries such as Zambia Brazil Zimbabwe Madagascar Pakistan India Afghanistan and Russia In the US emeralds can be found in North Carolina In 1998 emeralds were discovered in the YukonEmerald is a rare and valuable gemstone and as such it has provided the incentive for developing synthetic emeralds Both hydrothermal and fluxgrowth synthetics have been produced The first commercially successful emerald synthesis process was that of Carroll ChathamGemology Project The other large producer of flux emeralds was Pierre Gilson Sr which has been on the market since 1964 Gilsons emeralds are usually grown on natural colorless beryl seeds which become coated on both sides Growth occurs at the rate of 1 mm per month a typical sevenmonth growth run producing emerald crystals of 7 mm of thicknessNassau K 1980 Gems Made By Man Gemological Institute of America ISBN 0873110161 The green color of emeralds is attributed to presence of Cr3 ionsGolden beryl and heliodorGolden beryl can range in colors from pale yellow to a brilliant gold Unlike emerald golden beryl has very few flaws The term golden beryl is sometimes synonymous with heliodor from Greek hlios   sun  dron   gift but golden beryl refers to pure yellow or golden yellow shades while heliodor refers to the greenishyellow shades The golden yellow color is attributed to Fe3 ions Both golden beryl and heliodor are used as gems Probably the largest cut golden beryl is the flawless 2054 carat stone on display in the Hall of Gems DCGosheniteColorless beryl is called goshenite The name originates from Massachusetts where it was originally discovered Since all these color varieties are caused by impurities and pure beryl is colorless it might be tempting to assume that goshenite is the purest variety of beryl However there are several elements that can act as inhibitors to color in beryl and so this assumption may not always be true The name goshenite has been said to be on its way to extinction and yet it is still commonly used in the gemstone markets Goshenite is found to some extent in almost all beryl localities In the past goshenite was used for manufacturing eyeglasses and lenses owing to its transparency Nowadays it is most commonly used for gemstone purposes and also considered as a source of berylliumThe gem value of goshenite is relatively low However goshenite can be colored yellow green pink blue and in intermediate colors by irradiating it with highenergy particles The resulting color depends on the content of Ca Sc Ti V Fe and Co impuritiesMorganiteMorganite also known as pink beryl rose beryl pink emerald and cesian or caesian beryl is a rare light pink to rosecolored gemquality variety of beryl Orangeyellow varieties of morganite can also be found and color banding is common It can be routinely heat treated to remove patches of yellow and is occasionally treated by irradiation to improve its color The pink color of morganite is attributed to Mn2 ions Pink beryl of fine color and good sizes was first discovered on an island on the coast of Madagascar in 1910 It was also known with other gemstone minerals such as tourmaline and kunzite at California In December 1910 the New York Academy of Sciences named the pink variety of beryl

separates it from the province of Saskatchewan while on the west its boundary with British Columbia follows the meridian west south from the Northwest Territories at 60N until it reaches the Divide at the Mountains and from that point follows the line of peaks marking the Continental Divide in a generally southeasterly direction until it reaches the Montana border at 49NThe province extends  north to south and  east to west at its maximum width Its highest point is  at the summit of Mount Columbia in the Rocky Mountains along the southwest border while its lowest point is  on the River in Buffalo National Park in the northeastWith the exception of the semiarid steppe of the southeastern section the province has adequate resources There are numerous rivers and lakes used for swimming fishing and a range of sports There are three large lakes Lake Claire  in Buffalo National Park Slave Lake  and Athabasca  which lies in both Alberta and Saskatchewan The longest river in the province is the River which travels  from the Icefield in the Rocky Mountains to Lake Athabasca The largest river is the Peace River with an average flow of 2161 m3s The Peace River originates in the Rocky Mountains of northern British Columbia and flows through northern Alberta and into the River a tributary of the RiverFileMoraine Lake 17092005jpgthumb250pxrightLake in National ParkAlbertas capital city Edmonton is located approximately in the geographic centre of the province It is the most northerly major city in Canada and serves as a gateway and hub for resource development in northern Canada The region with its proximity to Canadas largest fields has most of western Canadas oil refinery capacity Calgary is located approximately  south of Edmonton and  north of Montana surrounded by extensive ranching country Almost 75 of the provinces population lives in the CorridorMost of the northern half of the province is forest while the Mountains along the southwestern boundary are largely forested see Mountain forests and Columbia foothills forests The southern quarter of the province is prairie ranging from prairie in the southeastern corner to mixed grass prairie in an arc to the west and north of it The central parkland region extending in a broad arc between the prairies and the forests from Calgary north to Edmonton and then east to Lloydminster contains the most fertile soil in the province and most of the population Much of the unforested part of Alberta is given over either to grain or to farming with farming more common in the north and centre while ranching and agriculture predominate in the southThe Alberta badlands are located in southeastern Alberta where the Deer River crosses the flat prairie and farmland and features deep canyons and striking landforms Provincial Park near Alberta showcases the badlands terrain desert flora and remnants from Albertas past when dinosaurs roamed the then lush landscape Climate Alberta has a dry climate with warm summers and cold winters The province is open to cold arctic weather systems from the north which often produce extremely cold conditions in winter As the fronts between the air masses shift north and south across Alberta temperature can change rapidly Arctic air masses in the winter produce extreme minimum temperatures varying from  in northern Alberta to  in southern Alberta In the summer continental air masses produce maximum temperatures from  in the mountains to  in southern AlbertaAlberta extends for over  from north to south its climate therefore varies considerably Average temperatures in January range from  in the south to  in the north and in July from  in the south to  in the north  The climate is also influenced by the presence of the Rocky Mountains to the southwest which disrupt the flow of the prevailing westerly winds and cause them to drop most of their moisture on the western slopes of the mountain ranges before reaching the province casting a shadow over much of Alberta The northerly location and isolation from the weather systems of the Ocean cause Alberta to have a dry climate with little moderation from the ocean Annual precipitation ranges from  in the southeast to  in the north except in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains where rainfall can reach  annuallyIn the summer the average daytime temperatures range from around  in the Rocky Mountain valleys and far north to  in the dry prairie of the southeast The northern and western parts of the province experience higher rainfall and lower evaporation rates caused by cooler summer temperatures The south and eastcentral portions are prone to droughtlike conditions sometimes persisting for several years although even these areas can receive heavy precipitationAlberta is a sunny province Annual bright sunshine totals range between 1900 and 2500 hours per year Northern Alberta receives about 18 hours of daylight in the summerIn southwestern Alberta the cold winters are frequently interrupted by warm dry winds blowing from the mountains which can propel temperatures upward from frigid conditions to well above the freezing point in a very short period During one chinook recorded at Creek temperatures soared from  to  in one hour  The region around Lethbridge has the most chinooks averaging 30 to 35 chinook days per year while Calgary has a Christmas only 59 of the time as a result of these winds Northern Alberta is mostly covered by boreal forest and has a climate The agricultural area of southern Alberta have a semiarid steppe climate because the annual precipitation is less than the water that evaporates or is used by plants The southeastern corner of Alberta part of the Triangle experiences greater summer heat and lower rainfall than the rest of the province and as a result suffers frequent yield problems and occasional severe droughts Western Alberta is protected by the mountains and enjoys the mild temperatures brought by winter winds Central and parts of northwestern Alberta in the Peace River region are largely aspen parkland a biome transitional between prairie to the south and boreal forest to the northAfter Ontario Alberta is the most likely region in Canada to experience tornadoes Thunderstorms some of them severe are frequent in the summer especially in central and southern Alberta The region surrounding the Corridor is notable for having the highest frequency of hail in Canada which is caused by lifting from the nearby Rocky Mountains enhancing the updraftdowndraft cycle necessary for the formation of hailImageBanff Trail 2jpgWinter climate at Banff Trail station in CalgaryImageDinosaurProvincialParkHoodoojpgHoodoos in Provincial ParkImageMay 2011 Wildfires in Alberta

other early flowers The advancing summer introduces many flowers of the sunflower family until in August the plains are one blaze of yellow and purple The southern and east central parts of Alberta are covered by a short nutritious grass which dries up as summer lengthens to be replaced by hardy perennials such as the prairie coneflower fleabane and sage Both yellow and white clover fill the ditches with their beauty and aromatic scentsThe trees in the parkland region of the province grow in clumps and belts on the hillsides These are largely deciduous typically aspen poplar and willow Many species of willow and other shrubs grow in virtually any terrain On the north side of the North Saskatchewan River evergreen forests prevail for hundreds of thousands of square kilometres Aspen

usually of rats arriving in the province aboard trucks or by rail In 2006 Alberta Agriculture reports zero findings of wild rats the only rat interceptions have been domesticated rats that have been seized from their owners It is illegal for individual Albertans to own or keep Norwegian rats of any description the animals can be kept in the province by only zoos universities and colleges and recognized research institutions In 2009 several rats werefound and captured in small pockets in Southern Alberta putting Albertas ratfree status in jeopardy History FileAlexander Rutherfordjpgrightthumb150pxC Rutherford Albertas first premierThe first people in Alberta were PaleoIndians who arrived in Alberta at least 10000 years ago toward the end of the ice age They probably migrated from Siberia to Alaska on a land bridge across the Strait and then may have moved down the east side of the Mountains through Alberta to settle the Americas Alternatively they may have migrated down the coast of British Columbia and then moved inland Over time they differentiated into various Nations peoples including the Indian tribes of southern Alberta such as those of the Confederacy and the Cree who generally lived by hunting buffalo bison and the more northerly tribes such as the Cree and  Chipewyan who hunted trapped and fished for a livingAfter the British arrival in Canada approximately half of the province of Alberta south of the River drainage became part of Land which consisted of all land drained by rivers flowing into Bay This area was granted by II of England to the Bay Company HBC in 1670 and rival fur trading companies were not allowed to trade in it After the arrival of Canadians in the west around 1731 they settled near fur trading posts establishing communities such as Lac La Biche and Bonnyville Fort La Jonquire was established near what is now Calgary in 1752The Athabasca River and the rivers north of it were not in HBC territory because they drained into the Ocean instead of Hudson Bay and they were prime habitat for furbearing animals The first explorer of the Athabasca region was Pond who learned of the Portage which allowed travel from southern  rivers into the rivers north of Ruperts Land  Fur traders formed the West Company NWC of Montreal to compete with the HBC in 1779 The NWC occupied the northern part of Alberta territory Peter Pond built Fort Athabasca on Lac la Biche in 1778 Roderick Mackenzie built Chipewyan on Lake Athabasca ten years later in 1788 His cousin Sir Alexander Mackenzie followed the Saskatchewan River to its northernmost point near Edmonton then setting northward on foot trekked to the Athabasca River which he followed to Lake Athabasca It was there he discovered the mighty outflow river which bears his namethe Riverwhich he followed to its outlet in the Ocean Returning to Lake Athabasca he followed the Peace River upstream eventually reaching the Ocean and so he became the first white man to cross the North American continent north of MexicoThe extreme southernmost portion of Alberta was part of the French and Spanish territory of Louisiana sold to the United States in 1803 in 1818 the portion of Louisiana north of the FortyNinth Parallel was ceded to Great BritainFur trade expanded in the north but bloody battles occurred between the rival HBC and NWC and in 1821 the British government forced them to merge to stop the hostilities The amalgamated Hudsons Bay Company dominated trade in Alberta until 1870 when the newly formed Government purchased Ruperts Land Northern Alberta was included in the Territory until 1870 when it and Ruperts land became Canadas TerritoriesThe district of Alberta was created as part of the NorthWest Territories in 1882 As settlement increased local representatives to the NorthWest Legislative Assembly were added After a long campaign for autonomy in 1905 the district of Alberta was enlarged and given provincial status with the election of Cameron Rutherford as the first premier Demographics Alberta has enjoyed a relatively high rate of growth in recent years mainly because of its burgeoning economy Between 2003 and 2004 the province had high birthrates on par with some larger provinces such as British Columbia relatively high immigration and a high rate of interprovincial migration when compared to other provincesApproximately 81 of the population live in urban areas and only about 19 live in rural areas The CalgaryEdmonton Corridor is the most urbanized area in the province and is one of the most

about 315 billion barrels 50 km3 of bitumen are recoverable McMurray one of Canadas fastest growing  cities has grown enormously in recent years because of the large corporations which have taken on the task of oil production As of late 2006 there were over 100 billion in oil sands projects under construction or in the planning stages in northeastern AlbertaAnother factor determining the viability of oil extraction from the sands is the price of oil The price increases since 2003 have made it more than profitable to extract this oil which in the past would give little profit or even a

requires that all the money raised by this property tax must go to the support of K12 education provided by school boards The provincial government pools the property tax funds from across the province and distributes them according to a formula to public and separate school jurisdictions and Francophone authoritiesPublic and separate school boards schools and schools all follow the Program of Studies and the curriculum approved by the provincial department of education Alberta Education Home schoolers may choose to follow the Program of Studies or develop their own Program of Studies  Public and separate schools charter schools and approved private schools all employ teachers who are certificated by Alberta Education they administer Provincial Achievement Tests and Diploma Examinations set by Alberta Education and they may grant high school graduation certificates endorsed by Alberta Education Universities FileSaint Josephs College University Of Alberta Edmonton Alberta Canada 02Ajpgthumb230pxrightSt Josephs College at the of AlbertaThe of Alberta established in Edmonton in 1908 is Albertas oldest and largest university The of Calgary once affiliated with the University of Alberta gained its autonomy in 1966 and is now the second largest university in Alberta There is also University which focuses on distance learning and the of Lethbridge both of which are located in their title citiesIn early September 2009 Royal University became Calgarys second public university and in late September 2009 a similar move made MacEwan University Edmontons second public university There are 15 colleges that receive direct public funding along with two technical institutes Alberta Institute of Technology and Alberta Institute of TechnologyThere is also a large and active private sector of postsecondary institutions mostly Christian Universities bringing the total number of universities to twelve plus a University in Calgary the only location in Canada Students may also receive government loans and grants while attending selected private institutions There has been some controversy in recent years over the rising cost of postsecondary education for students as opposed to taxpayers In 2005 Premier Klein made a promise that he would freeze tuition and look into ways of reducing schooling costs So far no plan has been released by the government of Alberta Culture FileStampedeRodeo2002JPG200pxrightthumbThe StampedeSummer brings many festivals to the province of Alberta especially in Edmonton The Fringe Festival is the worlds  second largest

Football League and Hockey League teams Soccer union and lacrosse are also played professionally in AlbertaPaleontologyFilePachyrhinosaurus skulljpgthumbright200pxPachyrhinosaurus skull Large quantities of this genus are preserved in the FormationAlberta has one of the greatest diversities and abundances of Cretaceous dinosaur fossils in the world Taxa are represented by complete fossil skeletons isolated material microvertebrate remains and even mass graves At least 38 dinosaur specimens are known from the province The Formation Formation and Park Formations collectively comprise the Judith River Group and are the most thoroughly studied dinosaur bearing strata in Alberta The stratigraphy of the River Group has a confusing history due partly to the use of the MontanaAlberta border as an artificial division between equivalent strata The modern Judith River Group stratigraphy was not finalized until 1993 when Eberth and Hamblin divided the Oldman Formation in two to create the new Dinosaur Park Formation The resulting paleontological confusion was resolved by Currie who relocated old quarries dinosaurs had been found in and determined their distribution within the modern stratigraphic frameworkDinosaurbearing strata are distributed widely throughout Alberta The Provincial Park area contains outcrops of the Dinosaur Park Formation and Oldman Formation In the central and southern regions of Alberta are intermittent Formation outcrops In the Valley and Edmonton regions there are exposed Horseshoe Canyon facies Other formations have been recorded as well like the Milk River and Foremost Formations However these latter two have a lower diversity of documented dinosaurs primarily due to their lower total fossil quantity and neglect from collectors who are hindered by the isolation and scarcity of exposed outcrops Their dinosaur fossils are primarily teeth recovered from microvertebrate fossil sites Additional geologic formations that have produced only few fossils are the River Group and Mary River Formations of the southwest and the northwestern Formation The Wapiti Formations contains two Pachyrhinosaurus bone beds that break its general trend of low productivity however The Formation represents strata deposited during a transgression Dinosaurs are known from this Formation but represent specimens washed out to sea or reworked from
