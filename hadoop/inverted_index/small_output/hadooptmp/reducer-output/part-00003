Park in Western AustraliaThe Outback is the vast remote arid area of Australia  term colloquially can refer to any lands outside the main areas The term the outback is generally used to refer to locations that are comparatively more remote than those areas named bushOverviewThe outback is home to a diverse set of animal species such as the kangaroo emu and dingo The Fence was built to restrict dingo movements into agricultural areas towards the south east of the continent The marginally fertile parts are primarily utilised as rangelands and have been traditionally used for sheep or cattle grazing on stations which are leased from the Federal Government While small areas of the outback consist of clay soils the majority has exceedingly infertile palaeosols Riversleigh in Queensland is one of Australias most renowned fossil sites and was recorded as a Heritage site in 1994 The  area contains fossil remains of ancient mammals birds and reptiles of Oligocene and Miocene ageHistoryEarly European exploration of inland Australia was sporadic More focus was on the more accessible and fertile coastal areas The first party to successfully cross the Blue Mountains just outside Sydney was led by Blaxland in 1813 25 years after the colony was established People starting with Oxley in 1817 1818 and 1821 followed by Sturt in 18291830 attempted to follow the westwardflowing rivers to find an inland sea but these were found to all flow into the River and River which turn southOver the period 1858 to 1861 McDouall Stuart led six expeditions north from Adelaide into the outback culminating in successfully reaching the north coast of Australia and returning without the loss of any of the partys members lives This contrasts with the illfated and Wills expedition in 186061 which was much better funded but resulted in the deaths of three of the four members of the transcontinental partyThe Telegraph line was constructed in the 1870s along the route identified by Stuart who had found enough water to support the needed repeater stationsExploration of the outback continued in the 1950s when Beadell explored surveyed and built many roads in support of the nuclear weapons tests at Field and Maralinga and rocket testing on the Prohibited Area Mineral exploration continues as new mineral deposits are identified and developedWhile the early explorers used horses to cross the outback the first woman to make the journey riding a horse was Hingley who rode from Broome to Cairns in 2006First woman conquers OutbackMiningOther than agriculture and tourism the main economic activity in this vast and sparsely settled area is mining Owing to the complete absence of mountain building and glaciation since the Permian in many areas since the Cambrian ages the outback is extremely rich in iron aluminium manganese and uranium ores and also contains major deposits of gold nickel iron lead and zinc ores Because of its size the value of grazing and mining is considerable Major mines and mining areas in the outback include opals at Coober Pedy Lightning Ridge and White Cliffs metals at Broken Hill Tennant Creek Olympic Dam and the remote Mine Oil and gas are extracted in the Basin around MoombaIn Western Australia the diamond mine in the Western Australia is the worlds biggest producer of natural diamonds and contributes approximately onethird of the worlds natural supply The Pilbara regions economy is dominated by mining and petroleum industriesThe Pilbaras oil and gas industry is the regions largest export industry earning 50 billion in 200405 accounting for over 96 of the States production source  WAgovau Most of Australias ore is also mined in the Pilbara and it also has one of the worlds major manganese mines Woodie Woodie Population Owing to the low and erratic rainfall over most of the outback combined with soils which are usually not very fertile inland Australia is relatively sparsely settled More than 90 percent of Australians live in urban areas on the coast However the outback and the history of its exploration and settlement provides Australians with a culturally valued backdrop and stories of swagmen squatters and bushrangers are central to the national ethos The song Matilda which is about a swagman and squatters is probably Australias best internationally known and most wellloved songAboriginal communities in outback regions have not been displaced as they have been in areas of intensive agriculture and large cities in coastal areas So a significant proportion of the countrys indigenous population lives in the OutbackWorld Book Encyclopedia in areas such as the Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara lands in northern South AustraliaMedicineImageOutbackjpgthumbrightFlying over

conventional school to operate Children are educated at home by the of the Air Originally the teachers communicated with the children via radio but now satellite telecommunication is used insteadSome children attend boarding school mostly only those in secondary schoolTerminologyCulturally many urban Australians have had very generalised terms for the otherwise complex range of environments that exist within the inland and tropical regions of the continent Regional terminology can be very specific to specific locations in each mainland stateThe concept of back country which initially meant land beyond the settled regions was in existence in 1800 Crossing of the Blue Mountains and other exploration of the inland however gave a different dimension to the perception The term outback was first used in print in 1869 when the writer clearly meant west of Wagga Wagga New South WalesCoupe Sheena ed  Frontier Country Vol 1 Weldon Russell Publishing Willoughby 1989 ISBN 1 875202 01 3It is colloquially said that the outback is located beyond the Stump The location of the black stump may be some hypothetical location or may vary depending on local custom and folklore It has been suggested that the term comes from the Black Stump Wine Saloon that once stood about 10 kilometres out of New South Wales on the Gunnedah Road It is claimed that the saloon named after the nearby Black Stump Run and Black Stump Creek was an important staging post for traffic to northwest New South Wales and it became a marker by which people gauged their journeysImageWest MacDonnell National ParkJPGthumbleftThe MacDonnell Ranges in the Territory are found in the centre of the countryThe NeverNever is a term referring to remoter parts of the Australian outback The outback can be also referred to as back of beyond  back o Bourke although these terms are more frequently used when referring to something a long way from anywhere or a long way away The wellwatered north of the continent is often called the End and the arid interior The Red Centre owing to its vast amounts of red soil and sparse greenery amongst its landscapeWildlifethumb100pxrightA Brumby in the OutbackThe Australian Outback is full of very welladapted wildlife although much of it may not be immediately visible to the casual observer  Many animals such as kangaroos and dingoes hide in bushes to rest and keep cool during the heat of the dayBirdlife is prolific most often seen at waterholes at dawn and dusk  Huge flocks of budgerigars cockatoos corellas and galahs are often sighted On bare ground or roads during the winter various species of snakes and lizards bask in the sun but they are rarely seen during the summer monthsFeral animals such as camels thrive in central Australia brought to Australia by the early Afghan drivers Feral horses known as brumbies are station horses that have run wild  Feral pigs foxes cats and rabbits are also imported animals that degrade the environment so time and money is spent eradicating them in an attempt to help protect fragile rangelandsTourismFileCooberPedyOodnadatta4WDMailTruckInTheOutbackJPGthumbThe Pedy Oodnadatta One Day Mail Run OKA bus in

RegionVisitors to the outback often drive their own or rented vehicles or take organised tours Travel through remote areas on main roads is easily done and requires no planning  However travel through very remote areas on isolated tracks requires planning and a suitable reliable vehicle usually a drive On very remote routes considerable supplies and equipment may be required this can include prearranged caches It is not advisable to travel into these especially remote areas with a single vehicle unless fully equipped with good communication technology eg a satellite phone EPIRB etc  Many visitors prefer to travel in these areas in a convoy Deaths from tourists and locals becoming stranded on outback trips occasionally occur sometime because insufficient water and food supplies were taken or because people have walked away from their vehicle in search of help  Travellers through very remote areas should always inform a reliable person of their route and expected destination arrival time and remember that a vehicle is much easier to locate in an aerial search than a person so in the event of a breakdown they must not leave their vehicleTransportthumbrightA road sign warning of potentially dangerous conditions aheadThe outback is crisscrossed by historic tracks Most of the major highways have an excellent bitumen surface and other major roads are usually wellmaintained dirt roads  Tracks in very sandy or exceedingly rocky areas may require highclearance four wheel drives and spare fuel tyres food and water before attempting to travel them however most outback roads are easily traversed in ordinary vehicles provided care is taken  Drivers unused to dirt roads should be especially cautious  it is recommended that drivers reduce their speed drive with extra care and avoid driving at night because animals can stray on to roads  Travelling in remote areas in northern Australia is not advisable during the wet season November to April as heavy tropical downpours can quickly make dirt roads impassable In the remotest parts of Australia fuel sellers are located hundreds of kilometres apart so spare fuel must be carried or refuelling spots calculated carefully in order not to run out of fuel in between towns In addition multiple trailer trucks known as Road Trains traverse these roads and extreme care must be taken when around these vehicles due to their weight length often three full trailers long and amount of dust thrown up by 46 tyresThe Highway runs from north to south through the centre of the continent roughly paralleled by the railway There is a proposal to develop some of the roads running from the SW to the NE to create an allweather road named the Highway crossing the continent diagonally from Western Australia north of Kalgoorlie through the Northern Territory to Winton in QueenslandAir transport is relied on for mail delivery in some areas owing to sparse settlement and wetseason road closures  Most outback mines have an airstrip and many have a flyout workforce Most outback stations and stations have an airstrip and quite a few have their own light plane Medical and ambulance services are provided by the

4910	Beryl The mineral beryl is a beryllium aluminium cyclosilicate with the formula Be3Al2SiO36 The hexagonal crystals of beryl may be very small or range to several meters in size Terminated crystals are relatively rare Pure beryl is colorless but it is frequently tinted by impurities possible colors are green blue yellow red and whiteEtymologyThe name beryl is derived via Latin beryllus French beryl and English beril from Greek  beryllos which referred to a precious bluegreen colorofseawater stone and originated from Prakrit veruliya  and Pali veuriya  veiru  or viar  to become pale ultimately from Sanskrit  vaidurya which is of Dravidian origin maybe from the name of BelurBeryl Online Etymology Dictionary Retrieved on 20110419 The term was later adopted for the mineral beryl more exclusively The Late Latin word berillus was abbreviated as brill which produced the Italian word brillare meaning shine the French word brille meaning shine and the English word brilliancethe oracle  bssm encyclopaedia Soulhuntercom Retrieved on 20110419DepositsBeryl of various colors is found most commonly in granitic pegmatites but also occurs in mica schists in the Ural Mountains and limestone in Colombia Beryl is often associated with tin and tungsten ore bodies Beryl is found in Europe in Norway Austria Germany Sweden especially morganite and Ireland as well as Brazil Colombia Madagascar Mozambique Russia Africa the States and Zambia US beryl locations are in California Colorado Connecticut Idaho Maine Hampshire Carolina Dakota and UtahEnglands pegmatites have produced some of the largest beryls found including one massive crystal from the Quarry in Maine with dimensions 55 m by 12 m 18 ft by 4 ft with a mass of around 18 metric tons it is New Hampshires state mineral As of 1999 the largest known crystal of any mineral in the world is a crystal of beryl from Madagascar 18 meters long and 35 meters in diameterG Cressey and I F Mercer Crystals London Natural History Museum 1999VarietiesAquamarine and maxixeAquamarine from  water of the sea is a blue or turquoise variety of beryl It occurs at most localities which yield ordinary beryl some of the finest coming from Russia The gemgravel placer deposits of Lanka contain aquamarine Clear yellow beryl such as that occurring in Brazil is sometimes called aquamarine chrysolite When corundum presents the bluish tint of typical aquamarine it is often termed Oriental aquamarine The deep blue version of aquamarine is called maxixe Its color fades to white when exposed to sunlight or is subjected to heat treatment though the color returns with irradiation The pale blue color of aquamarine is attributed to Fe2 The Fe3 ions produce goldenyellow color and when both Fe2 and Fe3 are present the color is a darker blue as in maxixe Decoloration of maxixe by light or heat thus may be due to the charge transfer Fe3 and Fe2 Darkblue maxixe color can be produced in green pink or yellow beryl by irradiating it with highenergy particles rays neutrons or even Xrays In the States aquamarines can be found at the summit of Mt Antero in the Range in central Colorado In Wyoming aquamarine has been discovered in the Horn Mountains near River Pass In Brazil there are mines in the states of Gerais Santo and Bahia and minorly in Grande do Norte The Mines of Colombia Zambia Madagascar Malawi Tanzania and Kenya also produce aquamarineThe largest aquamarine of gemstone quality ever mined was found in Marambaia Minas Gerais Brazil in 1910 It weighed over 110 kg and its dimensions were  long and  in diameterEmeraldEmerald refers to green beryl colored by trace amounts of chromium and sometimes vanadium The word emerald comes via English Emeraude imported from French smeraude and Latin Esmaraldus from Latin smaragdus from Greek smaragdos   green gem its original source being a Semitic word izmargad  or the Sanskrit word marakata  meaning green Most emeralds are highly included so their brittleness resistance to breakage is classified as generally poor Emeralds in antiquity were mined by the Egyptians and in Austria as well as Swat in northern Pakistan A rare type of emerald known as a trapiche emerald is occasionally found in the mines of Colombia A trapiche emerald exhibits a star pattern it has raylike spokes of dark carbon impurities that give the emerald a sixpointed radial pattern It is named for the trapiche a grinding wheel used to process sugarcane in the region Colombian emeralds are generally the most prized due to their transparency and fire Some of the most rare emeralds come from three main emerald mining areas in Colombia Muzo Coscuez and Chivor Fine emeralds are also found in other countries such as Zambia Brazil Zimbabwe Madagascar Pakistan India Afghanistan and Russia In the US emeralds can be found in North Carolina In 1998 emeralds were discovered in the YukonEmerald is a rare and valuable gemstone and as such it has provided the incentive for developing synthetic emeralds Both hydrothermal and fluxgrowth synthetics have been produced The first commercially successful emerald synthesis process was that of Carroll ChathamGemology Project The other large producer of flux emeralds was Pierre Gilson Sr which has been on the market since 1964 Gilsons emeralds are usually grown on natural colorless beryl seeds which become coated on both sides Growth occurs at the rate of 1 mm per month a typical sevenmonth growth run producing emerald crystals of 7 mm of thicknessNassau K 1980 Gems Made By Man Gemological Institute of America ISBN 0873110161 The green color of emeralds is attributed to presence of Cr3 ionsGolden beryl and heliodorGolden beryl can range in colors from pale yellow to a brilliant gold Unlike emerald golden beryl has very few flaws The term golden beryl is sometimes synonymous with heliodor from Greek hlios   sun  dron   gift but golden beryl refers to pure yellow or golden yellow shades while heliodor refers to the greenishyellow shades The golden yellow color is attributed to Fe3 ions Both golden beryl and heliodor are used as gems Probably the largest cut golden beryl is the flawless 2054 carat stone on display in the Hall of Gems DCGosheniteColorless beryl is called goshenite The name originates from Massachusetts where it was originally discovered Since all these color varieties are caused by impurities and pure beryl is colorless it might be tempting to assume that goshenite is the purest variety of beryl However there are several elements that can act as inhibitors to color in beryl and so this assumption may not always be true The name goshenite has been said to be on its way to extinction and yet it is still commonly used in the gemstone markets Goshenite is found to some extent in almost all beryl localities In the past goshenite was used for manufacturing eyeglasses and lenses owing to its transparency Nowadays it is most commonly used for gemstone purposes and also considered as a source of berylliumThe gem value of goshenite is relatively low However goshenite can be colored yellow green pink blue and in intermediate colors by irradiating it with highenergy particles The resulting color depends on the content of Ca Sc Ti V Fe and Co impuritiesMorganiteMorganite also known as pink beryl rose beryl pink emerald and cesian or caesian beryl is a rare light pink to rosecolored gemquality variety of beryl Orangeyellow varieties of morganite can also be found and color banding is common It can be routinely heat treated to remove patches of yellow and is occasionally treated by irradiation to improve its color The pink color of morganite is attributed to Mn2 ions Pink beryl of fine color and good sizes was first discovered on an island on the coast of Madagascar in 1910 It was also known with other gemstone minerals such as tourmaline and kunzite at California In December 1910 the New York Academy of Sciences named the pink variety of beryl morganite after financier P Morgan On October 7 1989 one of the largest gem morganite specimens ever uncovered eventually called The Rose of Maine was found at the Bennett Quarry in Buckfield Maine
