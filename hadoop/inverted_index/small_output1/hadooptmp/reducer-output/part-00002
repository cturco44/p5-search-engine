isooctyl ester formIOM 1994 p 90Numerous studies have examined health effects linked to Agent Orange its component compounds and its manufacturing byproductsFrumkin 2003 pp245255Prior to the controversy surrounding Agent Orange there was already a large body of scientific evidence linking 245T and 24D to serious negative health effects and ecological damageYoung 2009 p 2 But in 1969 it was revealed to the public that the 245T was contaminated with a dioxin 2378tetrachlorodibenzodioxin TCDD and that the TCDD was causing many of the previously unexplained adverse health effects which were correlated with Agent Orange exposureYoung 2009 p 6 TCDD has been described as perhaps the most toxic molecule ever synthesized by manSchuck 1987 p 18 Internal memoranda revealed Monsanto Corporation a manufacturer of 245T had informed the US government as early as 1952 that 245T was contaminated with a toxic contaminantSchuck 1987 p 17 In the manufacture of 245T accidental overheating of the reaction mixture easily causes the product to condense into the toxic selfcondensation product TCDD At the time precautions were not taken against this unintended side reaction which caused also the disaster in Italy in 1976 In addition to this 245T is hazardous in its own rightIn 1979 the Yale biologist Arthur Galston who specialized in herbicide research published a review of what was known at the time about the toxicity of TCDD Even vanishingly small quantities of dioxin in the diet caused adverse health effects when tested on animals Since then TCDD has been comprehensively studied It has been associated with increased neoplasms in every animal bioassay reported in the scientific literatureDwyer and FleschJanys Editorial Agent Orange in Vietnam Journal of Public Health

2008Early developmentIn 1943 plant biologist Galston began studying the compound acid as a plant growth hormone in an attempt to adapt soybeans to a short growing season Galston found that excessive usage of the compound caused catastrophic defoliation  a finding later used by his colleague Ian Sussex to develop the family of herbicides used in Operation Ranch HandPearce Jeremy Arthur Galston

environmentPeterson Doug Arthur W Galston Matters of Light LASNews Magazine of Illinois Spring 2005In 1943 the US Department of the Army contracted the University of Chicago to study the effects of 24D and 245T on cereal grains including rice and broadleaf crops From these studies arose the concept of using aerial applications of herbicides to destroy enemy crops to disrupt their food supply In early 1945 the US army ran tests of various 24D and 245T mixtures at the Army Airfield in Florida which is now listed as a Used Defense Site FUDSYoung 2009 p24Verwey 1977 p 111Use in the Vietnam WarDuring the Vietnam War between 1962 and 1971 the United States military sprayed nearly  of chemical herbicides and defoliants in Vietnam eastern Laos and parts of Cambodia as part of the aerial defoliation program known as Ranch Hand The goal was to defoliate ruralforested land depriving guerrillas of food and cover and clearing in sensitive areas such as around base perimetersTucker Spencer Encyclopedia of the Vietnam War Political Social and Military History ABCCLIO Inc Santa Barbara 1998 The program was also a part of a general policy of draft urbanization which aimed to destroy the ability of peasants to support themselves in the countryside forcing them to flee to the US dominated cities depriving the guerrillas of their rural support baseSpraying was usually done either from helicopters or from lowflying Provider aircraft fitted with sprayers and MC1 Hourglass pump systems and  chemical tanks Spray runs were also conducted from trucks boats and backpack sprayersSchuck

records show at least 6542 spraying missions took place over the course of Operation Ranch Hand By 1971 12 percent of the total area of South Vietnam had been sprayed with defoliating chemicals at an average concentration of 13 times the recommended USDA application rate for domestic use In South Vietnam alone an estimated 10 million hectares of agricultural land were ultimately destroyed In some areas TCDD concentrations in soil and water were hundreds of times greater than the levels considered safe by the Environmental Protection AgencyThe campaign destroyed  of upland and mangrove forests and millions of acres of crops Overall more than 20 of South Vietnams forests were sprayed at least once over a nine year periodIn 1965 members of the US Congress were told crop destruction is understood to be the more important purpose  but the emphasis is usually given to the jungle defoliation in public mention of the programVerwey 1977 p 113 Soldiers were told they were destroying crops because they were going to be used to feed guerrillas They later discovered nearly all of the food they had been destroying was not being produced for guerrillas it was in reality only being grown to support the local civilian population For example in Quang Ngai province 85 of the crop lands were scheduled to be destroyed in 1970 alone Widespread famine occurred as a result leaving hundreds of thousands of people malnourished or starvingVerwey 1977 p 116The US military began targeting food crops in October 1962 primarily using Blue the American public was not made aware of the crop destruction programs until 1965 and it was then believed that crop spraying had begun that spring In 1965 42 percent of all herbicide spraying was dedicated to food crops The first official acknowledgement of the programs came from the Department in March 1966Many experts at the time including Arthur Galston the biologist who developed and intensively studied TCDD opposed herbicidal warfare due to concerns about the side effects to humans and the environment by indiscriminately spraying the chemical over a wide area As early as 1966 resolutions were introduced to the Nations charging that the US was violating the 1925 Protocol which regulated the use of chemical and biological weaponsSchuck 1987 p 19Effects on the Vietnamese peopleHealth effectsThe Vietnam Red Cross reported as many as 3 million Vietnamese people have been affected by Agent Orange including at least 150000 children born with birth defects According to Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs 48 million Vietnamese people were exposed to Agent Orange resulting in 400000 people being killed or maimed and 500000 children born with birth defectsChildren in the areas where Agent Orange was used have been affected and have multiple health problems including cleft palate mental disabilities hernias and extra fingers and toes In the 1970s high levels of dioxin were found in the milk of South Vietnamese women and in the blood of US soldiers who had served in Vietnam The most affected zones are the mountainous area along Truong Son Long Mountains and the border between Vietnam and Cambodia

war which dramatically disrupted ecological equilibrium Furthermore the persistent nature of dioxins erosion caused by loss of protective tree cover and loss of seeding forest stock meant reforestation was difficult or impossible in many areasFurukawa 2004 p 215 Many defoliated forest areas were quickly invaded by aggressive pioneer species such as bamboo and grass which make it unlikely the forests will be able to regenerate Animal species diversity was also significantly impacted in one study a Harvard biologist found 24 species of birds and 5 species of mammals in a sprayed forest while in two adjacent sections of unsprayed forest there were 145 and 170 species of birds and 30 and 55 species of mammalsDioxins from Agent Orange have persisted in the Vietnamese environment since the war settling in the soil and sediment and entering into food chain through the animals and fish that feed in the contaminated areas Movement of dioxins through the web has resulted in bioconcentration and biomagnification The areas most heavily contaminated with dioxins are the sites of former US air basesFurukawa 2004 pp 221222Sociopolitical effectsThe Corporations

conditions the US Veterans Administration has found to be associated with exposure to Agent Orangedioxin and are on the list of conditions eligible for compensation and treatmentMilitary personnel who loaded airplanes and helicopters used in Ranch Hand probably sustained some of the heaviest exposures Members of the Chemical Corps who stored and mixed herbicides and defoliated the perimeters of military bases are also thought to have had some of the heaviest exposures Others with potentially heavy exposures included members of Army Special Forces units who defoliated remote campsites and

Children Political Affairs April 25 2006 After returning home Vietnam veterans began to suspect their ill health or the instances of their wives having miscarriages or children born with birth defects may be related to Agent Orange and the other toxic herbicides to which they were exposed in Vietnam Veterans began to file claims in 1977 to the Department of Veterans Affairs for disability payments for health care for conditions they believed were associated with exposure to Agent Orange or more specifically dioxin but their claims were denied unless they could prove the condition began when they were in the service or within one year of their dischargeBy April 1993 the Department of Veterans Affairs had only compensated 486 victims although it had received disability claims from 39419

Evening News May 7 1980 Hartzs deposition was one of the first ever taken in America and the first for an Agent Orange trial for the purpose of preserving testimony at trial as it was understood that Hartz would not live to see the trial because of the tumor that began to develop while he was a member of Force Forces and LRRPs in VietnamPottstown Mercury The firm also located and supplied critical research to the Veterans lead expert Dr Ronald A Codario MD including about 100 hundred articles from toxicology journals dating back more than a decade as well as data about where herbicides had been sprayed what the effects of dioxin had been on animals and humans and every accident in factories where herbicides were produced or dioxin was a contaminant of some chemical reactionIn 1984 the classaction suit was settled out of court for 180 million slightly over 45 of this was ordered to be paid by Monsanto alone Many veterans who were victims of Agent Orange exposure were outraged the case had been settled instead of going to court and felt they had been betrayed by the lawyers Fairness Hearings were held in five major American cities where veterans and their families discussed their reactions to the settlement and condemned the actions of the lawyers and courts demanding the case be heard before a jury of their peers Federal Judge Julius Weinstein refused the appeals claiming the settlement was fair and just By 1989 the veterans fears were confirmed when it was decided how the money from the settlement would be paid out A totally disabled Vietnam veteran would receive a maximum of 12000 spread out over the course of 10 years Furthermore by accepting the settlement payments disabled veterans would become ineligible for many state benefits that provided far more monetary support than the settlement such as food stamps public assistance and government pensions A widow of a Vietnam veteran who died of Agent Orange exposure would only receive 3700In 2004 Jill Montgomery a spokesperson for Monsanto said Monsanto should not be liable at all for injuries or deaths caused by Agent Orange saying We are sympathetic with people who believe they have been injured and understand their concern to find the cause but reliable scientific evidence indicates that Agent Orange is not the cause of serious longterm health effectsNew Jersey Agent Orange CommissionIn 1980 Jersey created the New Jersey Agent Orange Commission the first state commission created to study its effects The commissions research project in association with University was called The Pointman Project It was disbanded by Governor Todd Whitman in 1996New York Times July 3 1996During Pointman I commission researchers devised ways to determine small dioxin levels in blood Prior to this such levels could only be found in the adipose fat tissue The project compared dioxin levels in a small group of Vietnam veterans who had been exposed to Agent Orange with a group of matched veterans who had not served in Vietnam The results of this project were published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1988Journal of the American Medical Association Vol 259 No 11 March 18 1988The second phase of the project continued to examine and compare dioxin levels in various groups of Vietnam veterans including Army Marines and brown water riverboat Navy personnelUS CongressIn 1991 the US Congress enacted the Orange Act giving the Department of Veterans Affairs the authority to declare certain conditions presumptive to exposure to Agent Orangedioxin making these veterans who served in Vietnam eligible to receive treatment and compensation for these conditionsAgent Orange  Office of Public Health and Environmental Hazards The same law required the National Academy of Sciences to periodically review the science on dioxin and herbicides used in Vietnam to inform the Secretary of Veterans Affairs about the strength of the scientific evidence showing association between exposure to Agent Orangedioxin and certain conditionsPL 1024 and The National Academy of SciencesThrough this process the list of presumptive conditions has grown since 1991 and currently the US Department of Veterans Affairs has listed prostate cancer respiratory cancers multiple myeloma type II diabetes Hodgkins disease nonHodgkins lymphoma soft tissue sarcoma chloracne porphyria cutanea tarda peripheral neuropathy chronic lymphocytic leukemia and spina bifida in children of veterans exposed to Agent Orange as conditions associated with exposure to the herbicide This list now includes B cell leukemias such as hairy cell leukemia Parkinsons disease and ischemic heart disease these last three having been added on August 31 2010 Several highly placed individuals in government are voicing concerns about whether some of the diseases on the list should in fact actually have been includedUSVietnamese government negotiationsIn 2002 Vietnam and the US held a joint conference on Human Health and Environmental Impacts of Agent Orange Following the conference the US Institute of Environmental Health Sciences NIEHS began scientific exchanges between the US and Vietnam and began discussions for a joint research project on the human health impacts of Agent Orange Young 2009 p 310These negotiations broke down in 2005 when neither side could agree on the research protocol and the research project was cancelled More progress has been made on the environmental front In 2005 the first USVietnam workshop on remediation of dioxin was held Young 2009 p 310Starting in 2005 the US Environmental Protection Agency EPA began to work with the Vietnamese government to measure the level of dioxin at the Nang Airbase Also in 2005 the Joint Advisory Committee on Agent Orange made up of representatives of Vietnamese and US government agencies was established The committee has been meeting yearly to explore areas of scientific cooperation technical assistance and environmental remediation of dioxinA breakthrough in the diplomatic stalemate on this issue occurred as a result of United States President George W Bushs state visit to Vietnam in November 2006 In the joint statement President Bush and Triet agreed further joint efforts to address the environmental contamination near former dioxin storage sites would make a valuable contribution to the continued development of their bilateral relationshipJoint Statement Between the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and the United States of America Pres George W Bush Whitehouse Press

Iraq and Afghanistan that included an earmark of 3 million specifically for funding for programs for the remediation of dioxin hotspots on former US military bases and for public health programs for the surrounding communitiesMartin May 2009 p 2 some authors consider this to be completely inadequate pointing out that the US airbase in Nang alone will cost 14 million to clean up and that three others are estimated to require 60 million for cleanup The appropriation was renewed in the fiscal year 2009 and again in FY 2010 An additional 12 million was appropriated in the fiscal year 2010 in the Supplemental Appropriations Act and a total of 185 million appropriated for fiscal year 2011  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated during a visit to Hanoi in October 2010 that the US government would begin work on the cleanup of dioxin contamination at the Da Nang airbase   In June 2011 a ceremony was held at Da Nang airport to mark the start of USfunded decontamination of dioxin

a rights group the Vietnam Association for Victims of Agent Orangedioxin VAVA filed a lawsuit in the States District Court for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn against several US companies for liability in causing personal injury by developing and producing the chemical Dow Chemical and Monsanto were the two largest producers of Agent Orange for the US military and were named in the suit along with the dozens of other companies Diamond Shamrock Uniroyal Thompson Chemicals Hercules etc On March 10 2005 Judge B Weinstein of the Eastern District  who had presided over the 1984 US veterans class action lawsuit  dismissed the lawsuit ruling there was no legal basis for the plaintiffs claims He concluded Agent Orange was not considered a poison under law at the time of its use by the US the US was not prohibited from using it as a herbicide and the companies which produced the substance were not liable for the method of its use by the government The US government was not a party in the lawsuit due to immunity and the court ruled the chemical companies as contractors of the US government shared the same immunity The case was appealed and heard by the Circuit Court of Appeals on June 18 2007 The Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal of the case stating the herbicides used during the war were not intended to be used to poison humans and therefore did not violate international lawFebruary 22 2008 Decision by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals re Vietnam Association of Victims of Agent Orange v Dow Chemical Co The Supreme Court declined to consider the caseThree judges on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan heard the appeal on June 18 2007 They upheld Weinsteins ruling to dismiss the case They ruled that though the herbicides contained a dioxin a known poison they were not intended to be used as a poison on humans Therefore they were not considered a chemical weapon and thus not a violation of international law A further review of the case by the whole panel of judges of the Court of Appeals also confirmed this decision The lawyers for the Vietnamese filed a petition to the US Supreme Court to hear the case On March 2 2009 the Supreme Court denied certiorari and refused to reconsider the ruling of the Court of AppealsIn a November 2004 International poll of 987 people 79 of respondents thought the US chemical companies which produced Agent Orange defoliant should compensate US soldiers who were affected by the toxic chemical used during the war in Vietnam 51 said they supported compensation for Vietnamese Agent Orange victimsVietnam Ministry of Foreign Affairs Americans support compensations for Agent Orange victims poll November 22 2004Help for those affected in VietnamTo assist those who have been affected by Agent Orangedioxin the Vietnamese have established peace villages which each host between 50 and 100 victims giving them medical and psychological help As of 2006 there were 11 such villages thus granting some social protection to fewer than a thousand victims US veterans of the war in Vietnam and individuals who are aware and sympathetic to the impacts of Agent Orange have supported these programs in Vietnam An international group of veterans from the US and its allies during the Vietnam War working with their former enemy  veterans from the Vietnam Veterans Association  established the Vietnam Friendship Village outside of HanoiThe center provides medical care rehabilitation and vocational training for children and veterans from Vietnam who have been affected by Agent Orange In 1998 The Red Cross established the Vietnam Agent Orange Victims Fund to provide direct assistance to families throughout Vietnam that have been affected In 2003 the Association of Victims of Agent Orange VAVA was formed In addition to filing the lawsuit against the chemical companies VAVA provides medical care rehabilitation services and financial assistance to those injured by Agent OrangeThe Vietnamese government provides small monthly stipends to more than 200000 Vietnamese believed affected by the herbicides this totaled 408 million in 2008 alone The Vietnam Red Cross has raised more than 22 million to assist the ill or disabled and several US foundations United Nations agencies European governments and nongovernmental organizations have given a total of about 23 million for site

4482	Liberal Party UK colours  Yellow historically orange and before that greenThe Liberal Party was one of the two major political parties of the Kingdom during the 19th and early 20th centuries It was a third party of negligible importance throughout the latter half of the 20th Century before merging with the Social Democratic Party SDP in 1988 to form the present day Democrats The party was generally considered to be on the centreleft of the political spectrum and advocated liberalismIt grew out of the Whig Party in 1859 and Gladstone carried the party through governments in the late 19th century The party split over the issue of Irish Home Rule but returned to power in 1906 through a landslide victory During this time in government the Liberals are credited with the socalled Liberal Reforms which saw the creation of a basic state During World War I the Liberals governed Britain through a coalition with the Conservatives which ended in 1922 In the 1920s the Labour Party permanently replaced the Liberals as Britains main centreleft party and the Liberals went into decline which culminated in them winning as few as 6 seats at general elections during the 1950s A comeback of sorts was seen during the 1960s and 1970s but it was not until 1981 when the Liberals allied with the newly formed SDP to form the Alliance that the party enjoyed significant electoral success In the 1983 general election the alliance took 25 of the popular vote but this only translated into 23 seats During 1988 the Liberals formally merged with the SDP to form the Liberal Democrats though a small splinter Liberal Party was formed in 1989 by former members opposed to the mergerIdeologyDuring the 19th century the Liberal Party was broadly in favour of what would today be called liberalism supporting laissezfaire economic policies such as trade and minimal government interference in the economy this doctrine was usually termed Liberalism after the era Liberal Prime Minister Ewart Gladstone The Liberal Party favoured social reform personal liberty reducing the powers of Crown and the of England many of them were Nonconformists and an extension of the electoral franchise Sir William Harcourt a prominent Liberal politician in the Victorian era said this about liberalism in 1872FileLeeds Town Hall General Election resultsjpgthumbrightA crowd waits outside Town Hall to see them elect a Liberal Party candidate during the 1880 general electionsIf there be any party which is more pledged than another to resist a policy of restrictive legislation having for its object social coercion that party is the Liberal party Cheers But liberty does not consist in making others do what you think right Hear hear The difference between a free Government and a Government which is not free is principally thisthat a Government which is not free interferes with everything it can and a free Government interferes with nothing except what it must A despotic Government tries to make everybody do what it wishes a Liberal Government tries as far as the safety of society will permit to allow everybody to do as he wishes It has been the tradition of the Liberal party consistently to maintain the doctrine of individual liberty It is because they have done so that England is the place where people can do more what they please than in any other country in the worldIt is this practice of allowing one set of people to dictate to another set of people what they shall do what they shall think what they shall drink when they shall go to bed what they shall buy and where they shall buy it what wages they shall get and how they shall spend them against which the Liberal party have always protestedThe Times 31 December 1872 p 5The political terms of modern progressive or new Liberalism began to appear in the mid to late 1880s and became increasingly common to denote the tendency in the Liberal Party to favour an increased role for the state as more important than the classical liberal stress on selfhelp and freedom of choiceW H Greenleaf The British Political Tradition Volume II The Ideological Heritage London Methuen 1983 p 143By the early 20th century the Liberals stance began to shift towards New Liberalism what would today be called liberalism a belief in personal liberty with a support for government intervention to provide minimum levels of welfare This shift was best exemplified by the Liberal government of Henry Asquith and his Chancellor Lloyd George whose reforms in the early 1900s created a basic stateDavid Lloyd George adopted a programme at the 1929 general election entitled We Can Conquer Unemployment although by this stage the Liberals had declined to thirdparty status The Liberals now as expressed in the Liberal Yellow Book regarded opposition to state intervention as being a characteristic of rightwing extremistsLiberal Industrial Inquiry Britains Industrial Future London 1928 p 453After nearly becoming extinct in the 1940s and 50s the Liberal Party revived its fortunes somewhat under the leadership of Grimond in the 1960s by positioning itself as a radical centrist nonsocialist alternative to the Conservative and Labour Party governments of the timeOriginsthumbleftViscount PalmerstonThe Liberal Party grew out of the Whigs which had its origins as an aristocratic faction in the reign of Charles II The Whigs were in favour of reducing the power of The Crown and increasing the power of the Parliament Although their motives in this were originally to gain more power for themselves the more idealistic Whigs gradually came to support an expansion of democracy for its own sake The great figures of reformist Whiggery were James Fox died 1806 and his disciple and successor Earl Grey After decades in opposition the Whigs came to power under Grey in 1830 and carried the First Reform Act in 1832The Reform Act was the climax of Whiggery but also brought about the Whigs demise The admission of the middle classes to the franchise and to the House of Commons led eventually to the development of a systematic class liberalism and the end of Whiggery although for many years reforming aristocrats held senior positions in the party In the years after Greys retirement the party was led first by Lord Melbourne a fairly traditional Whig and then by Lord John Russell the son of a Duke but a crusading radical and Lord Palmerston a renegade Irish Tory and essentially a conservative although capable of radical gesturesAs early as 1839 Russell had adopted the name Liberal Party but in reality the party was a loose coalition of Whigs in the of Lords and Radicals in the Commons The leading Radicals were Bright and Cobden who represented the manufacturing towns that had gained representation under the Reform Act They favoured social reform personal liberty reducing the powers of the Crown and the of England many of them were Nonconformists avoidance of war and foreign alliances which were bad for business and above all trade For a century free trade was the one cause which could unite all LiberalsIn 1841 the Liberals lost office to the Conservative Party under Sir Peel but their period in opposition was short because the Conservatives split over the repeal of the Laws a free trade issue and a faction known as the Peelites but not Peel himself who died soon after defected to the Liberal side This allowed ministries led by Russell Palmerston and the Peelite Lord Aberdeen to hold office for most of the 1850s and 1860s The leading Peelite was Ewart Gladstone who was a zealous reforming of the Exchequer in most of these governments The formal foundation of the Liberal Party is traditionally traced to 1859 and the formation of Palmerstons second governmentThe WhigRadical amalgam could not become a true modern political party however while it was dominated by aristocrats and it was not until the departure of the Two Terrible Old Men Russell and Palmerston that Gladstone could become the first leader of the modern Liberal Party This was brought about by Palmerstons death in 1865 and Russells retirement in 1868 After a brief Conservative interlude during which the Second Reform Act was passed by agreement between the parties Gladstone won a huge victory at the 1868 election and formed the first Liberal government The establishment of the party as a national membership organisation came with the foundation of the Liberal Federation in 1877The Gladstonian erathumbrightWilliam GladstoneFor the next thirty years Gladstone and Liberalism were synonymous The Grand Old Man as he became known was Minister of the United Kingdom four times and the powerful flow of his rhetoric dominated British politics even when he was out of office His rivalry with the Conservative leader Disraeli became legendary Gladstone was a Church Anglican and enjoyed the company of aristocrats but he grew ever more progressive as he grew older he was as one wit put it a Tory in all but essentials Queen Victoria who had grown up as a Whig supporter under the tutelage of Melbourne became a Conservative in reaction to Gladstones moralising LiberalismGladstones great achievements in office were his reforms to education land reform particularly in Ireland where he ended centuries of landlord oppression the disestablishment of the Anglican of Ireland through the Church Act 1869 the introduction of democratic local government reform allowing the ballot the Act 1872 and removing electoral corruption the abolition of patronage in the civil service and the army and the Third Reform Act which greatly extended the vote to almost all adult males Gladstones reforming tendencies were borne partly out of his visit to Lancashire during The Cotton Famine where he was impressed by class qualities It was during the 1860s that Gladstone became known as The Peoples WilliamIn foreign policy Gladstone was in general against foreign entanglements but did not resist the reality of imperialism For example he approved of the occupation of Egypt by British forces in 1882In the 1874 general election Gladstone was defeated by the Conservatives under Disraeli during a sharp recession He formally resigned as Liberal leader and was succeeded by the Marquess of Hartington but he soon changed his mind and returned to active politics He strongly disagreed with Disraelis proOttoman foreign policy and in 1880 he conducted the first outdoor masselection campaign in Britain known as the campaign The Liberals won a large majority in the 1880 election Hartington ceded his place and Gladstone resumed officeAmong the consequences of the Reform Act 188485 was the giving of the vote to the Catholic peasants in Ireland and the consequent creation of an Parliamentary Party led by Stewart Parnell In the 1885 general election this party won the balance of power in the House of Commons and demanded Home Rule as the price of support for a continued Gladstone ministry Gladstone personally supported Home Rule but a strong Unionist faction led by Chamberlain along with the last of the Whigs Hartington opposed itThe result was a catastrophic split in the Liberal Party and heavy defeat in the 1886 election at the hands of Lord Salisbury There was a final weak Gladstone ministry in 1892 but it also was dependent on Irish support and failed to get Irish Home Rule through the House of Lords Gladstone finally retired in 1894 and his ineffectual successor Lord Rosebery led the party to another heavy defeat in the 1895 general electionAnother consequence of the Third Reform Act was the rise of LibLab candidates in the absence of any committed Labour Party The Act split all county constituencies which were represented by multiple MPs in to singlemember constituencies roughly corresponding to population patterns In areas with working class majorities in particular coalmining areas LibLab candidates were popular and they received sponsorship and endorsement from unions In the first election after the Act was passed 1885 thirteen were elected up from two in 1874 The Third Reform Act also facilitated the demise of the Whig old guard in twomember constituencies it was common to pair a Whig and a radical under the Liberal banner After the Third Reform Act fewer Whigs were selected as candidatesThe Liberal zenithImageAsquith Q 42036jpgthumbrightHenry AsquithThe Liberals languished in opposition for a decade while the coalition of Salisbury and Chamberlain held power The 1890s were marred by infighting between the three principal successors to Gladstone party leader William Harcourt former Prime Minister Lord Rosebery and Gladstones personal secretary Morley This intrigue finally led Harcourt and Morley to resign their positions in 1898 as they continued to be at loggerheads with Rosebery over Irish home rule and issues relating to imperialism Replacing Harcourt as party leader was Sir CampbellBannerman Harcourts resignation briefly muted the turmoil in the party but the beginning of the Boer War soon nearly broke the party apart with Rosebery and a circle of supporters including important future Liberal leaders HH Asquith Edward Grey and Richard Burdon Haldane forming a clique dubbed the Liberal Imperialists that supported the government in the prosecution of the war On the other side more radical members of the party formed a ProBoer faction that denounced the conflict and called for an immediate end to hostilities Quickly rising to prominence among the ProBoers was David Lloyd George a relatively new MP and a master of rhetoric who took advantage of having a national stage to speak out on a controversial issue to make his name in the party Harcourt and Morley also sided with this group though with slightly different aims CampbellBannerman tried to keep these forces together at the head of a moderate Liberal rump but in 1901 he delivered a speech on the governments methods of barbarism in South Africa that pulled him further to the left and nearly tore the party in two The party was saved after Salisburys retirement in 1902 when his successor Arthur Balfour pushed a series of unpopular initiatives such as a new education bill and Joseph Chamberlain called for a new system of protectionist tariffs CampbellBannerman was able to rally the party around the traditional liberal platform of free trade and land reform and led them to the greatest election victory in their history This would prove the last time the Liberals won a majority in their own rightAlthough he presided over a large majority Sir Henry CampbellBannerman was overshadowed by his ministers most notably Henry Asquith at the Exchequer Grey at the Foreign Office Richard Burdon Haldane at the War Office and Lloyd George at the Board of Trade An ill CampbellBannerman retired in 1908 and died later that year He was succeeded by Asquith who stepped up the governments radicalism Lloyd George succeeded Asquith at the Exchequer and was in turn succeeded at the Board of Trade by Churchill a recent defector from the ConservativesThe Liberals pushed through much legislation including the regulation of working hours Insurance and welfare It was at this time that a political battle over the socalled Budget resulted in the passage of an act ending the power of the of Lords to block legislation The cost was high however as the government was required by the king to call two general elections in 1910 to validate its position and ended up frittering away most of its large majority being left once again dependent on the Irish NationalistsAs a result Asquith was forced to introduce a new third Home Rule bill in 1912 Since the House of Lords no longer had the power to block the bill the Unionists Volunteers led by Sir Carson launched a campaign of opposition that included the threat of armed resistance in Ulster and the threat of mutiny by army officers in Ireland in 1914 see Incident In their resistance to Home Rule the Ulster Protestants had the full support of the Conservatives whose leader Andrew Bonar Law was of UlsterScots descent The country seemed to be on the brink of civil war when War I broke out in August 1914The war struck at the heart of everything British Liberals believed in The party became divided over the distinctly illiberal policies that were introduced under her auspices including conscription and the Defence of the Realm Act Several Cabinet ministers resigned and Asquith the master of domestic politics proved a poor war leader Lloyd George and Churchill however were zealous supporters of the war and gradually forced the old pacifist Liberals out The poor British performance in the early months of the war forced Asquith to invite the Conservatives into a coalition on 17 May 1915 This marked the end of the last allLiberal government This coalition fell apart at the end of 1916 when the Conservatives withdrew their support from Asquith and gave it to Lloyd George instead who became Prime Minister at the head of a coalition government largely made up of Conservatives Asquith and his followers moved to the opposition benches in Parliament and the Liberal Party was split once againLiberal declineImageDavid Lloyd GeorgejpgthumbrightLloyd GeorgeIn the 1918 general election Lloyd George the Man Who Won the War led his coalition into another election and won a sweeping victory over the Asquithian Liberals and the newly emerging Labour Party Lloyd George and the Conservative leader Andrew Bonar Law wrote a joint letter of support to candidates to indicate they were considered the official Coalition candidates  this coupon as it became known was issued against many sitting Liberal MPs often to devastating effect though not against Asquith himself Asquith and most of his colleagues lost their seats Lloyd George still claimed to be leading a Liberal government but he was increasingly under the influence of the rejuvenated Conservative party In 1922 the Conservative backbenchers rebelled against the continuation of the coalition citing in particular the Crisis over Turkey and Lloyd Georges corrupt sale of honours amongst other grievances and Lloyd George was forced to resign The Conservatives came back to power under Bonar Law and then BaldwinAt the 1922 and 1923 elections the Liberals won barely a third of the vote and only a quarter of the seats in the House of Commons as many radical voters abandoned the divided Liberals and went over to Labour In 1922 Labour became the official opposition A reunion of the two warring factions took place in 1923 when the new Conservative Prime Minister Baldwin committed his party to protective tariffs causing the Liberals to reunite in support of free trade The party gained ground in the 1923 general election but ominously made most of its gains from Conservatives whilst losing ground to Labour  a sign of the partys direction for many years to come The party remained the third largest in the House of Commons but the Conservatives had lost their majority There was much speculation and fear about the prospect of a Labour government and comparatively little about a Liberal government even though it could have plausibly presented an experienced team of ministers compared to Labours almost complete lack of experience as well as offering a middle ground that could get support from both Conservatives and Labour in crucial Commons divisions But instead of trying to force the opportunity to form a Liberal government Asquith decided instead to allow Labour the chance of office in the belief that they would prove incompetent and this would set the stage for a revival of Liberal fortunes at Labours expense It was a

Following success as the successor to the Whig party the partys share of the popular vote plummeted after the First World War as it lost votes to the new Labour party and fractured into groups such as the National and Coalition LiberalsLabour was determined to destroy the Liberals and become the sole party of the left  MacDonald was forced into a snap election in 1924 and although his government was defeated he achieved his objective of virtually wiping the Liberals out as many more radical voters now moved to Labour whilst moderate middleclass Liberal voters concerned about socialism moved to the Conservatives The Liberals were reduced to a mere forty seats in Parliament only seven of which had been won against candidates from both parties and none of these formed a coherent area of Liberal survival The party seemed finished and during this period some Liberals such as Churchill went over to the Conservatives while others went over to Labour Several Labour ministers of later generations such as Foot and Benn were the sons of Liberal MPsAsquith died in 1928 and the enigmatic figure of Lloyd George returned to the leadership and began a drive to produce coherent policies on many key issues of the day In the 1929 general election he made a final bid to return the Liberals to the political mainstream with an ambitious programme of state stimulation of the economy called We Can Conquer Unemployment largely written for him by the Liberal economist Maynard Keynes The Liberals gained ground but once again it was at the Conservatives expense whilst also losing seats to Labour Indeed the urban areas of the country suffering heavily from unemployment which might have been expected to respond the most to the radical economic policies of the Liberals instead gave the party its worst results By contrast most of the partys seats were won either due to the absence of a candidate from one of the other parties or in rural areas on the fringe where local evidence suggests that economic ideas were at best peripheral to the electorates concerns The Liberals now found themselves with 59 members holding the balance of power in a Parliament where Labour was the largest party but lacked an overall majority Lloyd George offered a degree of support to the Labour government in the hope of winning concessions including a degree of electoral reform to introduce the vote but this support was to prove bitterly divisive as the Liberals increasingly divided between those seeking to gain what Liberal goals they could achieve those who preferred a Conservative government to a Labour one and viceversaThe last majority Liberal Government in Britain was elected in 1906 The preWorld War I period in Britain was a period of worker strikes and civil unrest involving many violent confrontations between the policetroops and civilians Other issues of the period included the suffragettes and the Irish Independence movementAfter the carnage of 19141918 the democratic reform of the of the People Act 1918 instantly tripled the number of people allowed to vote in Britain from 7 to 21 million The Labour Party benefited the most from this huge change in the British electorate forming its first minority government in 1924The splits over the National Governmentthumb140pxHerbert SamuelIn 1931 MacDonalds government fell apart under the Great Depression and the Liberals agreed to join his National Government dominated by the Conservatives Lloyd George himself was ill and did not actually join Soon however the Liberals faced another divisive crisis when a National Government was proposed to fight the 1931 general election with a mandate for tariffs From the outside Lloyd George called for the party to abandon the government completely in defence of free trade but only a few MPs and candidates followed Another group under Sir John Simon then emerged who were prepared to continue their support for the government and take the Liberal places in the Cabinet if there were resignations The third group under Sir Herbert Samuel pressed for the parties in government to fight the election on separate platforms In doing so the bulk of Liberals remained supporting the government but two distinct Liberal groups had emerged within this bulk  the Liberal Nationals officially the National Liberals after 1947 led by Simon also known as Simonites and the Samuelites or official Liberals led by Samuel who remained as the official party Both groups secured about 34 MPs but proceeded to diverge even further after the election with the Liberal Nationals remaining supporters of the government throughout its life There were to be a succession of discussions about them rejoining the Liberals but these usually foundered on the issues of free trade and continued support for the National Government The one significant reunification came in 1946 when the Liberal and Liberal National party organisations in London mergedThe official Liberals found themselves a tiny minority within a government committed to protectionism Slowly they found this issue to be one they could not support In early 1932 it was agreed to suspend the principle of collective responsibility to allow the Liberals to oppose the introduction of tariffs Later in 1932 the Liberals resigned their ministerial posts over the introduction of the Ottawa Agreement on Preference However they remained sitting on the government benches supporting it in Parliament though in the country local Liberal activists bitterly opposed the government Finally in late 1933 the Liberals crossed the floor of the House of Commons and went into complete opposition By this point their number of MPs was severely depleted In the 1935 general election just 17 Liberal MPs were elected along with Lloyd George and three followers as independent Liberals Immediately after the election the two groups reunited though Lloyd George declined to play much of a formal role in his old party Over the next ten years there would be further defections as MPs deserted to either the Liberal Nationals or Labour Yet there were a few recruits such as Davies who had deserted to the National Liberals in 1931 but now returned to the party during the War II and who would lead it after the warNear extinctionSamuel had lost his seat in the 1935 election and the leadership of the party fell to Sir Archibald Sinclair With many traditional domestic Liberal policies now regarded as irrelevant he focused the party on opposition to both the rise of Fascism in Europe and the appeasement foreign policy of the British government arguing that intervention was needed in contrast to the Labour calls for pacifism Despite the partys weaknesses Sinclair gained a high profile as he sought to recall the Campaign and once more revitalise the Liberals as the party of a strong foreign policyIn 1940 they joined Churchills wartime coalition government with Sinclair serving as of State for Air the last British Liberal to hold Cabinet rank office for seventy years However it was a sign of the partys lack of importance that they were not included in the Cabinet At the 1945 general election Sinclair and many of his colleagues lost their seats to both Conservatives and Labour By 1951 there were only six MPs all but one of them were aided by the fact that the Conservatives refrained from fielding candidates in those constituencies In 1957 this total fell to five when one of the Liberal MPs died and the subsequent byelection was lost to the Labour Party which selected the former Liberal Deputy Leader Lady Megan Lloyd George as its own candidate The Liberal Party seemed close to extinction During this low period it was often joked that Liberal MPs could hold meetings in the back of one taxiLiberal revivalThrough the 1950s and into the 1960s the Liberals survived only because a handful of constituencies in rural Scotland and Wales clung to their Liberal traditions whilst in two English towns Bolton and Huddersfield local Liberals and Conservatives agreed to each contest only one of the towns two seats Grimond for example who became Liberal leader in 1956 was MP for the remote Orkney and Shetland islands Under his leadership a Liberal revival began marked by the Orpington byelection of March 1962 which was won by Eric Lubbock There  the Liberals won a seat in the London suburbs for the first time since 1935The Liberals became the first of the major British political parties to advocate British membership of the Economic Community Grimond also sought an intellectual revival of the party seeking to position it as a nonsocialist radical alternative to the Conservative government of the day In particular he canvassed the support of the young postwar university students and recent graduates appealing to younger voters in a way that many of his recent predecessors had not and asserting a new strand of Liberalism for the postwar worldThe new middleclass suburban generation began to find the Liberals policies attractive again Under Grimond who retired in 1967 and his successor Thorpe the Liberals regained the status of a serious third force in British politics polling up to 20 of the vote but unable to break the duopoly of Labour and Conservative and win more than fourteen seats in the Commons An additional problem was competition in the Liberal heartlands in Scotland and Wales from the National Party and Cymru who both grew as electoral forces from the 1960s onwards Although Hooson held on to the seat of Montgomeryshire upon Davies death in 1962 the party lost its other Welsh five Welsh seats between 1950 and 1966 In September 1966 the Liberal Party formed their own state party moving the Liberal Party into a fully federal structureRussell Deacon 2011 History of the Welsh Liberal party Welsh Academic Press In local elections Liverpool remained a Liberal stronghold with the party taking the plurality of seats on the elections to the new Liverpool Metropolitan Borough Council in 1973 In the February 1974 general election the Conservative government of Heath won a plurality of votes cast but the Labour Party gained a plurality of seats due to the Ulster Unionist MPs refusing to support the Conservatives after the Northern Ireland Agreement The Liberals now held the balance of power in the Commons Conservatives offered Thorpe the Office if he would join a coalition government with Heath Thorpe was personally in favour of it but the party insisted on a clear government commitment to introducing representation and a change of Prime Minister The former was unacceptable to Heaths Cabinet and the latter to Heath personally so the talks collapsed Instead a minority Labour government was formed under Wilson but with no formal support from Thorpe In the October 1974 general election the Liberals slipped back slightly and the Labour government won a waferthin majorityThorpe was subsequently forced to resign after allegations about his private life The partys new leader Steel negotiated the pact with Wilsons successor as Prime Minister Callaghan According to this pact the Liberals would support the government in crucial votes in exchange for some influence over policy The agreement lasted from 1977 to 1978 but proved mostly fruitless for two reasons the Liberals key demand of representation was rejected by most Labour MPs whilst the contacts between Liberal spokespersons and Labour ministers often proved detrimental such as between finance spokesperson Pardoe and of the Exchequer Healey who were mutually antagonisticAlliance with Social DemocratsWhen the Labour government fell in 1979 the Conservatives under Thatcher won a victory which served to push the Liberals back into the margins In 1981 defectors from the moderate wing of the Labour Party led by former Cabinet ministers Jenkins Owen and Williams founded the Social Democratic Party The new party and the Liberals quickly formed an alliance which briefly topped the opinion polls before being overtaken by the Tories and fought the 1983 and 1987 general elections jointly as the Alliance During 1982 and 1983 at the depths of Labours fortunes under Foot there was much talk of the Alliance becoming the dominant party of the left and even of Jenkins becoming Prime Minister In fact while the Alliance won over 20 of the vote each time it was still a long way behind Labour in terms of seats and as a result was disbanded after the 1987 election with the two parties merging the following year to form the Social and Liberal Democrats who a year after that become the Liberal DemocratsMerger with Social DemocratsIn 1988 the Liberals and Social Democrats merged to create what came to be called the Liberal Democrats Over twothirds of the members and all the serving MPs of the Liberal Party joined this party led first jointly by Steel and the SDP leader Robert Maclennan and later by Ashdown 198899

greater electoral success than the Liberal Party had done in the postwar era In the 2005 general election the Liberal Democrats elected 62 MPs to the House of Commons a far cry from the days when the Liberals had just 5 MPs and Liberalism as a political force had seemed moribundAs was the case with the Liberal Party for most of the 20th century the Liberal Democrats face constant questioning about which of the other two parties they are closer to in particular about which they would support in the event of a parliament The party is keen to maintain its independent identity however and argues that the need for a modern Liberal force in British politics has never been greaterIn the 2010 General Election the Conservative Party won more seats than any other but not enough to form a majority government After several days of negotiation the Liberal Democrats agreed to join the Conservatives as part of a coalition governmentThe post1988 Liberal PartyA group of Liberal opponents of the merger with the Social Democrats including Meadowcroft formerly Liberal MP for Leeds West and Paul Wiggin who served on Peterborough City Council as a Liberal continued under the old name of the Liberal Party This was legally a new organisation the headquarters records assets and debts of the old party were inherited by the Liberal Democrats but its constitution asserts it to be the same
