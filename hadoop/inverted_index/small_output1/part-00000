science that aims to create it AI textbooks define the field as the study and design of intelligent agents where an agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chances of success John McCarthy who coined the term in 1956 defines it as the science and engineering of making intelligent machinesThe field was founded on the claim that a central property of humans intelligencethe sapience of sapienscan be so precisely described that it can be simulated by a machineSee the Dartmouth proposal under Philosophy below This raises philosophical issues about the nature of the mind and the ethics of creating artificial beings issues which have been addressed by myth fiction and philosophy since antiquity Artificial intelligence has been the subject of optimismThe optimism referred to includes the predictions of early AI researchers see optimism in the history of AI as well as the ideas of modern transhumanists such as Kurzweil but has also suffered setbacksThe setbacks referred to include the ALPAC report of 1966 the abandonment of perceptrons in 1970 the Lighthill Report of 1973 and the collapse of the lisp machine market in 1987 and today has become an essential part of the technology industry providing the heavy lifting for many of the most difficult problems in computer scienceAI research is highly technical and specialized and deeply divided into subfields that often fail to communicate with each other Subfields have grown up around particular institutions the work of individual researchers the solution of specific problems longstanding differences of opinion about how AI should be done and the application of widely differing tools The central problems of AI include such traits as reasoning knowledge planning learning communication perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects General intelligence or AI is still among the fields long term goals HistoryThinking machines and artificial beings appear in myths such as Talos of Crete the bronze robot of Hephaestus and Pygmalions Galatea Human likenesses believed to have intelligence were built in every major civilization animated images were worshipped in Egypt and Greece and humanoid automatons were built by Yan Shi of Alexandria and AlJazari It was also widely believed that artificial beings had been created by ibn Hayyn Loew and Paracelsus By the 19th and 20th centuries artificial beings had become a common feature in fiction as in Shelleys Frankenstein or apeks Rossums Universal Robots McCorduck argues that all of these are examples of an ancient urge as she describes it to forge the gods Stories of these creatures and their fates discuss many of the same hopes fears and ethical concerns that are presented by artificial intelligenceMechanical or formal reasoning has been developed by philosophers and mathematicians since antiquity The study of logic led directly to the invention of the programmable digital electronic computer based on the work of mathematician Turing and others Turings of computation suggested that a machine by shuffling symbols as simple as 0 and 1 could simulate any conceivable act of mathematical deductionThis insight that digital computers can simulate any process of formal reasoning is known as the thesis This along with concurrent discoveries in neurology theory and cybernetics inspired a small group of researchers to begin to seriously consider the possibility of building an electronic brainThe field of AI research was founded at a conference on the campus of College in the summer of 1956 The attendees including John McCarthy Minsky Newell and Simon became the leaders of AI research for many decades They and their students wrote programs that were to most people simply astonishingRussell and Norvig write it was astonishing whenever a computer did anything kind of smartish  computers were solving word problems in algebra proving logical theorems and speaking English By the middle of the 1960s research in the US was heavily funded by the Department of Defense and laboratories had been established around the world AIs founders were profoundly optimistic about the future of the new field Simon predicted that machines will be capable within twenty years of doing any work a man can do and Minsky agreed writing that within a generation  the problem of creating artificial intelligence will substantially be solvedThey had failed to recognize the difficulty of some of the problems they facedSee  In 1974 in response to the criticism of James Lighthill and ongoing pressure from the US Congress to fund more productive projects both the US and British governments cut off all undirected exploratory research in AI The next few years when funding for projects was hard to find would later be called the winterIn the early 1980s AI research was revived by the commercial success of systems a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of one or more human experts By 1985 the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars At the same time Japans generation computer project inspired the US and British governments to restore funding for academic research in the field However beginning with the collapse of the Machine market in 1987 AI once again fell into disrepute and a second longer lasting winter beganIn the 1990s and early 21st century AI achieved its greatest successes albeit somewhat behind the scenes Artificial intelligence is used for logistics mining diagnosis and many other areas throughout the technology industryThe success was due to several factors the increasing computational power of computers see law a greater emphasis on solving specific subproblems the creation of new ties between AI and other fields working on similar problems and a new commitment by researchers to solid mathematical methods and rigorous scientific standardsOn 11 May 1997 Deep Blue became the first computer

leadingedge definition of artificial intelligence research is changing over time One pragmatic definition is AI research is that which computing scientists do not know how to do costeffectively today For example in 1956 character recognition OCR was considered AI but today sophisticated OCR software with a contextsensitive checker and checker software comes for free with most scanners No one would any longer consider alreadysolved computing science problems like OCR artificial intelligence todayLowcost entertaining chessplaying software is commonly available for tablet computers DARPA no longer

AI breakthrough explained but few consumers realize the technology sourceAI applications are no longer the exclusive domain of of defense RD but are now common place consumer items and inexpensive intelligent toysIn common usage the term AI no longer seems to apply to offtheshelf solved computingscience problems which may have originally emerged out of years of AI research Problems Can a machine act intelligently is still an problem Taking A machine can act intelligently as a hypothesis many researchers have attempted to build such a machineThe general problem of simulating or creating intelligence has been broken down into a number of specific subproblems These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers would like an intelligent system to display The traits described below have received the most attentionDeduction reasoning problem solving Early AI researchers developed algorithms that imitated the stepbystep reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions By the late 1980s and 90s AI research had also developed highly successful methods for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information employing concepts from probability and economicsFor difficult problems most of these algorithms can require enormous computational resources  most experience a explosion the amount of memory or computer time required becomes astronomical when the problem goes beyond a certain size The search for more efficient problem solving algorithms is a high priority for AI researchHuman beings solve most of their problems using fast intuitive judgments rather than the conscious stepbystep deduction that early AI research was able to model AI has made some progress at imitating this kind of subsymbolic problem solving agent approaches emphasize the importance of sensorimotor skills to higher reasoning net research attempts to simulate the structures inside human and animal brains that give rise to this skillKnowledge representationrightthumbAn ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those conceptsrepresentation and engineering are central to AI research Many of the problems machines are expected to solve will require extensive knowledge about the world Among the things that AI needs to represent are objects properties categories and relations between objects situations events states and time causes and effects knowledge about knowledge what we know about what other people know and many other less well researched domains A representation of what exists is an ontology borrowing a word from traditional philosophy of which the most general are called upper ontologiesAmong the most difficult problems in knowledge representation arereasoning and the problem Many of the things people know take the form of working assumptions For example if a bird comes up in conversation people typically picture an animal that is fist sized sings and flies None of these things are true about all birds John McCarthy identified this problem in 1969 as the qualification problem for any commonsense rule that AI researchers care to represent there tend to be a huge number of exceptions Almost nothing is simply true or false in the way that abstract logic requires AI research has explored a number of solutions to this problemThe breadth of knowledge The number of atomic facts that the average person knows is astronomical Research projects that attempt to build a complete knowledge base of knowledge eg Cyc require enormous amounts of laborious ontological engineering  they must be built by hand one complicated concept at a time A major goal is to have the computer understand enough concepts to be able to learn by reading from sources like the internet and thus be able to add to its own ontologyThe subsymbolic form of some knowledge Much of what people know is not represented as facts or statements that they could express verbally For example a chess master will avoid a particular chess position because it feels too exposed or an art critic can take one look at a statue and instantly realize that it is a fake These are intuitions or tendencies that are represented in the brain nonconsciously and subsymbolically Knowledge like this informs supports and provides a context for symbolic conscious knowledge As with the related problem of subsymbolic reasoning it is hoped that situated AI or intelligence will provide ways to represent this kind of knowledgePlanningImageHierarchicalcontrolsystemsvgthumb A control system is a form of system in which a set of devices and governing software is arranged in a hierarchyIntelligent agents must be able to set goals and achieve them They need a way to visualize the future they must have a representation of the state of the world and be able to make predictions about how their actions will change it and be able to make choices that maximize the utility or value of the available choicesIn classical planning problems the agent can assume that it is the only thing acting on the world and it can be certain what the consequences of its actions may be However if this is not true it must periodically check if the world matches its predictions and it must change its plan as this becomes necessary requiring the agent to reason under uncertaintyplanning uses the cooperation and competition of many agents to achieve a given goal behavior such as this is used by algorithms and intelligenceLearninglearning has been central to AI research from the beginningTuring discussed the centrality of learning as early as 1950 in his classic paper Machinery and Intelligence  In 1956 at the original Dartmouth AI summer conference Solomonoff wrote a report on unsupervised probabilistic machine learning An Inductive Inference Machinepdf scanned copy of the original version published in 1957 An Inductive Inference Machine IRE Convention Record Section on Information Theory Part 2 pp 5662learning is the ability to find patterns in a stream of input learning includes both classification and numerical regression Classification is used to determine what category something belongs in after seeing a number of examples of things from several categories Regression takes a set of numerical inputoutput examples and attempts to discover a continuous function that would generate the outputs from the inputs In learning the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones These can be analyzed in terms of theory using concepts like utility The mathematical analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of computer science known as learning theoryNatural language processingFileParseTreesvgthumb A tree represents the syntactic structure of a sentence according to some grammarlanguage processing gives machines the ability to read and understand the languages that humans speak Many researchers hope that a sufficiently powerful natural language processing system would be able to acquire knowledge on its own by reading the existing text available over the internet Some straightforward applications of natural language processing include retrieval or mining and translationMotion and manipulationThe field of robotics is closely related to AI Intelligence is required for robots to be able to handle such tasks as object manipulation and navigation with subproblems of localization knowing where you are mapping learning what is around you and planning figuring out how to get therePerceptionperception is the ability to use input from sensors such as cameras microphones sonar and others more exotic to deduce aspects of the world vision is the ability to analyze visual input A few selected subproblems are recognition facial recognition and recognitionSocial intelligencerobot at MIT MuseumjpgthumbKismet a robot with rudimentary social skillsEmotion and social skills play two roles for an intelligent agent First it must be able to predict the actions of others by understanding their motives and emotional states This involves elements of theory theory as well as the ability to model human emotions and the perceptual skills to detect emotions Also for good interaction an intelligent machine also needs to display emotions At the very least it must appear polite and sensitive to the humans it interacts with At best it should have normal emotions itselfCreativityA subfield of AI addresses creativity both theoretically from a philosophical and psychological perspective and practically via specific implementations of systems that generate outputs that can be considered creative or systems that identify and assess creativity A related area of computational research is Intuition and ImaginationGeneral intelligenceMost researchers hope that their work will eventually be incorporated into a machine with general intelligence known as AI combining all the skills above and exceeding human abilities at most or all of them A few believe that anthropomorphic features like consciousness or an brain may be required for such a projectMany of the problems above are considered AIcomplete to solve one problem you must solve them all For example even a straightforward specific task like translation requires that the machine follow the authors argument reason know what is being talked about knowledge and faithfully reproduce the authors intention social intelligence translation therefore is believed to be AIcomplete it may require AI to be done as well as humans can do it Approaches There is no established unifying theory or paradigm that guides AI research Researchers disagree about many issuesNils Nilsson writes Simply put there is wide disagreement in the field about what AI is all about  A few of the most long standing questions that have remained unanswered are these should artificial intelligence simulate natural intelligence by studying psychology or neurology Or is human biology as irrelevant to AI research as bird biology is to engineeringCan intelligent behavior be described using simple elegant principles such as logic or optimization Or does it necessarily require solving a large number of completely unrelated problemsCan intelligence be reproduced using highlevel symbols similar to words and ideas Or does it require subsymbolic processingJohn Haugeland who coined the term GOFAI Good OldFashioned Artificial Intelligence also proposed that AI should more properly be referred to as intelligence a term which has since been adopted by some nonGOFAI researchershttpciteseerxistpsueduviewdocdownloaddoi1011388384reprep1typepdfhttpbooksgooglecombookshlenlrida

consensus on how closely the brain should be simulatedIn the 1940s and 1950s a number of researchers explored the connection between neurology theory and cybernetics Some of them built machines that used electronic networks to exhibit rudimentary intelligence such as Grey Walters turtles and the Hopkins Beast Many of these researchers gathered for meetings of the Teleological Society at University and the Club in England By 1960 this approach was largely abandoned although elements of it would be revived in the 1980s Symbolic When access to digital computers became possible in the middle 1950s AI research began to explore the possibility that human intelligence could be reduced to symbol manipulation The research was centered in three institutions CMU Stanford and MIT and each one developed its own style of research Haugeland named these approaches to AI good old fashioned AI or GOFAI Cognitive simulation Economist Simon and Newell studied human problem solving skills and attempted to formalize them and their work laid the foundations of the field of artificial intelligence as well as science research and science Their research team used the results of  psychological experiments to develop programs that simulated the techniques that people used to solve problems This tradition centered at Mellon University would eventually culminate in the development of the Soar architecture in the middle 80s Logicbased Unlike Newell and Simon John McCarthy felt that machines did not need to simulate human thought but should instead try to find the essence of abstract reasoning and problem solving regardless of whether people used the same algorithms His laboratory at Stanford SAIL focused on using formal logic to solve a wide variety of problems including representation planning and learning Logic was also focus of the work at the of Edinburgh and elsewhere in Europe which led to the development of the programming language Prolog and the science of programming Antilogic or scruffy Researchers at MIT such as Minsky and Papert found that solving difficult problems in vision and language processing required adhoc solutions  they argued that there was no simple and general principle like logic that would capture all the aspects of intelligent behavior Schank described their antilogic approaches as scruffy as opposed to the neat paradigms at CMU and Stanford knowledge bases such as Lenats Cyc are an example of scruffy AI since they must be built by hand one complicated concept at a time Knowledgebased When computers with large memories became available around 1970 researchers from all three traditions began to build knowledge into AI applications This knowledge revolution led to the development and deployment of systems introduced by Feigenbaum the first truly successful form of AI software The knowledge revolution was also driven by the realization that enormous amounts of knowledge would be required by many simple AI applications Subsymbolic During the 1960s symbolic approaches had achieved great success at simulating highlevel thinking in small demonstration programs Approaches based on cybernetics or networks were abandoned or pushed into the backgroundThe most dramatic case of subsymbolic AI being pushed into the background was the devastating critique of perceptrons by Minsky and Papert in 1969 See of AI winter or Rosenblatt By the 1980s however progress in symbolic AI seemed to stall and many believed that symbolic systems would never be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition especially perception robotics learning and recognition A number of researchers began to look into subsymbolic approaches to specific AI problems Bottomup embodied situated behaviorbased or AI Researchers from the related field of robotics such as Brooks rejected symbolic AI and focused on the basic engineering problems that would allow robots to move and survive Their work revived the nonsymbolic viewpoint of the early cybernetics researchers of the 50s and reintroduced the use of theory in AI This coincided with the development of the mind thesis in the related field of science the idea that aspects of the body such as  movement perception and visualization are required for higher intelligence Computational Intelligence Interest in networks and connectionism was revived by Rumelhart and others in the middle 1980s These and other subsymbolic approaches such as systems and computation are now studied collectively by the emerging discipline of intelligenceStatisticalIn the 1990s AI researchers developed sophisticated mathematical tools to solve specific subproblems These tools are truly scientific in the sense that their results are both measurable and verifiable and they have been responsible for many of AIs recent successes The shared mathematical language has also permitted a high level of collaboration with more established fields like mathematics economics or research Stuart Russell and Norvig describe this movement as nothing less than a revolution and the victory of the neats Critiques argue that these techniques are too focussed on particular problems and have failed to address the long term goal of general intelligence Integrating the approaches Intelligent agent paradigm An agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions which maximize its chances of success The simplest intelligent agents are programs that solve specific problems More complicated agents include human beings and organizations of human beings such as firms The paradigm gives researchers license to study isolated problems and find solutions that are both verifiable and useful without agreeing on one single approach An agent that solves a specific problem can use any approach that works  some agents are symbolic and logical some are subsymbolic networks and others may use new approaches The paradigm also gives researchers a common language to communicate with other fieldssuch as theory and economicsthat also use concepts of abstract agents The intelligent agent paradigm became widely accepted during the 1990sarchitectures and architectures Researchers have designed systems to build intelligent systems out of interacting agents in a system A system with both symbolic and subsymbolic components is a intelligent system and the study of such systems is intelligence systems integration A control system provides a bridge between subsymbolic AI at its lowest reactive levels and traditional symbolic AI at its highest levels where relaxed time constraints permit planning and world modelling Brooks architecture was an early proposal for such a hierarchical system Tools In the course of 50 years of research AI has developed a large number of tools to solve the most difficult problems in science A few of the most general of these methods are discussed below Search and optimization Many problems in AI can be solved in theory by intelligently searching through many possible solutions Reasoning can be reduced to performing a search For example logical proof can be viewed as searching for a path that leads from premises to conclusions where each step is the application of an rule Planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals attempting to find a path to a target goal a process called analysis Robotics algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use local searches in space Many learning algorithms use search algorithms based on optimizationSimple exhaustive searches are rarely sufficient for most real world problems the search space the number of places to search quickly grows to astronomical numbers The result is a search that is too slow or never completes The solution for many problems is to use heuristics or rules of thumb that eliminate choices that are unlikely to lead to the goal called pruning the tree Heuristics supply the program with a best guess for the path on which the solution liesA very different kind of search came to prominence in the 1990s based on the mathematical theory of optimization For many problems it is possible to begin the search with some form of a guess and then refine the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made These algorithms can be visualized as blind climbing we begin the search at a random point on the landscape and then by jumps or steps we keep moving our guess uphill until we reach the top Other optimization algorithms are annealing search and optimizationcomputation uses a form of optimization search For example they may begin with a population of organisms the guesses and then allow them to mutate and recombine selecting only the fittest to survive each generation refining the guesses Forms of computation include intelligence algorithms such as ant colony or swarm optimization and algorithms such as algorithms and programming Logic Logic is used for knowledge representation and problem solving but it can be applied to other problems as well For example the satplan algorithm uses logic for planning and logic programming is a method for learningSeveral different forms of logic are used in AI research Propositional or logic is the logic of statements which can be true or false logic also allows the use of quantifiers and predicates and can express facts about objects their properties and their relations with each other logic is a version of firstorder logic which allows the truth of a statement to be represented as a value between 0 and 1 rather than simply True 1 or False 0 systems can be used for uncertain reasoning and have been widely used in modern industrial and consumer product control systems logic models uncertainty in a different and more explicit manner than fuzzylogic a given binomial opinion satisfies belief  disbelief  uncertainty  1 within a distribution By this method ignorance can be distinguished from probabilistic statements that an agent makes with high confidencelogics logics and circumscription are forms of logic designed to help with default reasoning and the problem Several extensions of logic have been designed to handle specific domains of knowledge such as logics calculus calculus and calculus for representing events and time causal calculus belief calculus and logicsProbabilistic methods for uncertain reasoningMany problems in AI in reasoning planning learning perception and robotics require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information AI researchers have devised a number of powerful tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economicsnetworks are a very general tool that can be used for a large number of problems reasoning using the inference algorithm learning using the algorithm planning using networks and perception using Bayesian networks Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering prediction smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data helping perception systems to analyze processes that occur over time eg Markov models or filtersA key concept from the science of economics is utility a measure of how valuable something is to an intelligent agent Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan using theory analysis information value theory These tools include models such as decision processes dynamic networks theory and design Classifiers and statistical learning methods The simplest AI applications can be divided into two types classifiers if shiny then diamond and controllers if shiny then pick up Controllers do however also classify conditions before inferring actions and therefore classification forms a central part of many AI systems Classifiers are functions that use matching to determine a closest match They can be tuned according to examples making them very attractive for use in AI These examples are known as observations or patterns In supervised learning each pattern belongs to a certain predefined class A class can be seen as a decision that has to be made All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set When a new observation is received that observation is classified based on previous experienceA classifier can be trained in various ways there are many statistical and learning approaches The most widely used classifiers are the neural networkmethods such as the vector machineneighbor algorithmmixture modelBayes classifierand decision treeThe performance of these classifiers have been compared over a wide range of tasks Classifier performance depends greatly on the characteristics of the data to be classified There is no single classifier that works best on all given problems this is also referred to as the no free lunch theorem Determining a suitable classifier for a given problem is still more an art than science Neural networks FileArtificial neural networksvgthumbA neural network is an interconnected group of nodes akin to the vast network of neurons in the brainThe study of neural networks began in the decade before the field AI research was founded in the work of Pitts and McCullough Other important early researchers were Rosenblatt who invented the perceptron and Werbos who developed the backpropagation algorithmThe main categories of networks are acyclic or neural networks where the signal passes in only one direction and neural networks which allow feedback Among the most popular feedforward networks are perceptrons perceptrons and basis networks Among recurrent networks the most famous is the net a form of attractor network which was first described by Hopfield in 1982 Neural networks can be applied to the problem of control for robotics or learning using such techniques as learning and learningtemporal memory is an approach that models some of the structural and algorithmic properties of the neocortex Control theory theory the grandchild of cybernetics has many important applications especially in robotics Languages AI researchers have developed several specialized languages for AI research including Lisp and PrologEvaluating progress In 1950 Alan Turing proposed a general procedure to test the intelligence of an agent now known as the test This procedure allows almost all the major problems of artificial intelligence to be tested However it is a very difficult challenge and at present all agents failArtificial intelligence can also be evaluated on specific problems such as small problems in chemistry handwriting recognition and gameplaying Such tests have been termed matter expert Turing tests Smaller problems provide more achievable goals and there are an everincreasing number of positive resultsThe broad classes of outcome for an AI test are 1 Optimal it is not possible to perform better 2 Strong superhuman performs better than all humans 3 Superhuman performs better than most humans 4 Subhuman performs worse than most humans For example performance at draughts is optimal performance at chess is superhuman and nearing strong superhuman see chessComputers versus humans and performance at many everyday tasks such as recognizing a face or crossing a room without bumping into something is subhumanA quite different approach measures machine intelligence through tests which are developed from mathematical definitions of intelligence Examples of these kinds of tests start in the late nineties devising intelligence tests using notions from complexity and compression Two major advantages of mathematical definitions are their applicability to nonhuman intelligences and their absence of a requirement for human testers Applications FileAutomated online assistantpngthumbAn online assistant providing customer service on a web page  one of many applications of artificial intelligenceArtificial intelligence techniques are pervasive and are too numerous to list  Frequently when a technique reaches mainstream use it is no longer considered artificial intelligence this phenomenon is described as the effect Competitions and prizes There are a number of competitions and prizes to promote research in artificial intelligence The main areas promoted are general machine intelligence conversational behavior datamining driverless cars robot soccer and games Platforms A platform or platform is defined as some sort of hardware architecture or software framework including application frameworks that allows software to run As Rodney BrooksBrooks RA How to build complete creatures rather than isolated cognitive simulators in K VanLehn ed Architectures for Intelligence pp 225239 Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Hillsdale NJ 1991 pointed out many years ago it is not just the artificial intelligence software that defines the AI features of the platform but rather the actual platform itself that affects the AI that results ie we need to be working out AI problems on realworld platforms rather than in isolationA wide variety of platforms has allowed different aspects of AI to develop ranging from systems albeit PCbased but still an entire realworld system to various robot platforms such as the widely available Roomba with open interfaceHacking Roomba  Search Results  atmel Philosophy Artificial intelligence by claiming to be able to recreate the capabilities of the human mind is both a challenge and an inspiration for philosophy Are there limits to how intelligent machines can be Is there an essential difference between human intelligence and artificial intelligence Can a machine have a mind and consciousness A few of the most influential answers to these questions are given belowTurings polite convention If a machine acts as intelligently as a human being then it is as intelligent as a human being Turing theorized that ultimately we can only judge the intelligence of a machine based on its behavior This theory forms the basis of the testThe Dartmouth proposal Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it This conjecture was printed in the proposal for the Dartmouth Conference of 1956 and represents the position of most working AI researchers Newell and Simons physical symbol system hypothesis A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action Newell and Simon argue that intelligences consists of formal operations on symbols Dreyfus argued that on the contrary human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation and on having a feel for the situation rather than explicit symbolic knowledge See critique of AIDreyfus criticized the necessary condition of the symbol system hypothesis which he called the psychological assumption The mind can be viewed as a device operating on bits of information according to formal rules  incompleteness theorem A system such as a computer program can not prove all true statementsThis is a paraphrase of the relevant implication of Gdels theorems Penrose is among those who claim that Gdels theorem limits what machines can do See Emperors New Mind Searles strong AI hypothesis The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds John Searle counters this assertion with his room argument which asks us to look inside the computer and try to find where the mind might be The brain argument The brain can be simulated Moravec Kurzweil and others have argued that it is technologically feasible to copy the brain directly into hardware and software and that such a simulation will be essentially identical to the original Predictions Artificial Intelligence is a common topic in both fiction and projections about the future of technology and society The existence of an artificial intelligence that rivals human intelligence raises difficult ethical issues and the potential power of the technology inspires both hopes and fearsIn fiction Artificial Intelligence has appeared fulfilling many roles includinga servant R2D2 in Warsa law enforcer KITT Knight Ridera comrade Lt Commander Data in Trek The Next Generationa conqueroroverlord Matrixa dictator Folded Handsa benevolent providerde facto ruler Culturean assassin Terminatora sentient race Battlestar GalacticaTransformersan extension to human abilities in the Shelland the savior of the human race Daneel Olivaw in the Robot SeriesShelleys Frankenstein considers a key issue in the of artificial intelligence if a machine can be created that has intelligence could it also feel If it can feel does it have the same rights as a human The idea also appears in modern fiction including the films I Robot Runner and Artificial Intelligence in which humanoid machines have the ability to feel human emotions This issue now known as rights is currently being considered by for example Californias for the Future although many critics believe that the discussion is premature The subject is profoundly discussed in the 2010 documentary film  Prayhttpwwwplugandprayfilmdeencontenthtml Independent documentary Plug  Pray featuring Joseph Weizenbaum and Raymond KurzweilMartin Ford author of The Lights in the Tunnel Automation Accelerating Technology and the Economy of the Future and others argue that specialized artificial intelligence applications robotics and other forms of automation will ultimately result in significant unemployment as machines begin to match and exceed the capability of workers to perform most routine and repetitive jobs Ford predicts that many knowledgebased occupationsand in particular entry level jobswill be increasingly susceptible to automation via expert systems machine learningMachine Learning A Job Killer and other AIenhanced applications AIbased applications may also be used to amplify the capabilities of lowwage offshore workers making it more feasible to outsource knowledge workWeizenbaum wrote that AI applications can not by definition successfully simulate genuine human empathy and that the use of AI technology in fields such as service or psychotherapyIn the early 70s Colby presented a version of Weizenbaums ELIZA known as DOCTOR which he promoted as a serious therapeutic tool  was deeply misguided Weizenbaum was also bothered that AI researchers and some philosophers were willing to view the human mind as nothing more than a computer program a position now known as computationalism To Weizenbaum these points suggest that AI research devalues human lifeMany futurists believe that artificial intelligence will ultimately transcend the limits of progress Kurzweil has used law which describes the relentless exponential improvement in digital technology to calculate that computers will have the same processing power as human brains by the year 2029 He also predicts that by 2045 artificial intelligence will reach a point where it is able to improve itself at a rate that far exceeds anything conceivable in the past a scenario that fiction writer Vinge named the singularityRobot designer Moravec cyberneticist Warwick and inventor Kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines will merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either This idea called transhumanism which has roots in Huxley and Ettinger has been illustrated in fiction as well for example in the manga in the Shell and the sciencefiction series DuneFredkin argues that artificial intelligence is the next stage in evolution an idea first proposed by Samuel Butlers among the Machines 1863 and expanded upon by George Dyson in his book of the

Botswana and Ndebele tribes who were making incursions into the territory from the northeast Tensions also escalated with the Boer settlers from the Transvaal to the east After appeals by the Batswana leaders III Bathoen and Sebele for assistance the British Government put Bechuanaland under its protection on 31 March 1885 The northern territory remained under direct administration as the Bechuanaland Protectorate and is modernday Botswana while the southern territory became part of the Colony and is now part of the northwest province of South Africa The majority of Setswanaspeaking people today live in South AfricaWhen the of South Africa was formed in 1910 out of the main British colonies in the region the Bechuanaland Protectorate Basutoland now Lesotho and Swaziland the High Commission Territories were not included but provision was made for their later incorporation However a vague undertaking was given to consult their inhabitants and although successive South African governments sought to have the territories transferred Britain kept delaying consequently it never occurred The election of the Nationalist government in 1948 which instituted apartheid and South Africas withdrawal from the Commonwealth in 1961 ended any prospect of incorporation of the territories into South AfricaAn expansion of British central authority and the evolution of tribal government resulted in the 1920 establishment of two advisory councils to represent both Africans and Europeans Proclamations in 1934 regularized tribal rule and powers A EuropeanAfrican advisory council was formed in 1951 and the 1961 constitution established a consultative legislative councilIn June 1964 Britain accepted proposals for a democratic selfgovernment in Botswana The seat of government was moved in 1965 from Mafikeng in South Africa to the newly established Gaborone which sits near its border The 1965 constitution led to the first general elections and to independence on 30 September 1966 Khama a leader in the independence movement and the legitimate claimant to the Ngwato chiefship was elected as the first president reelected twiceThe presidency passed to the sitting vice president Masire who was elected in his own right in 1984 and reelected in 1989 and 1994 Masire retired from office in 1998 The presidency passed to the sitting vice president Mogae who was

tree Adansonia digitataBotswana is currently facing two major environmental problems drought and desertification  The desertification problems predominantly stem from the severe times of drought in the country  Due to the drought 75 of the countrys human and animal populations are dependent on groundwater  Groundwater use has eased the effects of drought but has left a toll on the land Groundwater is retrieved through drilling deep boreholes which leads to the erosion of the land  Surface water is very scarce in Botswana and less than 5 of the agriculture in the country is sustainable by rainfall  Due to this 95 of the country raises cattle and livestock as a means for an income  Therefore it is not a surprise to see that 71 of the countrys land is used for communal grazing which has been a major cause for the desertification of the countrySince raising livestock has proven to be profitable for the people of Botswana the land is continuing to be exploited The animal populations have continued to dramatically increase From 1966 to 1991 the livestock population has increased from 17 million to 55 million  Similarly the human population has increased from 574000 in 1971 to 15 million in 1995 nearly a 200 increase  Over 50 of all households in Botswana own cattle which is presently the largest single source of rural income  Rangeland degradation or desertification is regarded as the reduction in land productivity as a result of overstocking and overgrazing or as a result of veld product gathering for commercial use  Degradation is exacerbated by the effects of drought and climate change  It has been reported that the Delta is drying up due to the increased grazing of livestock The Okavango Delta is one of the major semiforested wetlands in Botswana the largest inland delta in the world and is a crucial ecosystem to the survival of many animalsThe Department and Forestry and Range Resources has already begun to implement project to reintroduce indigenous vegetation into communities in Kgalagadi South Kweneng North and Boteti Reintroduction of indigenous vegetation will help with the degradation of the land The States Government has also entered into an agreement with Botswana giving them 7 million US dollars to reduce Botswanas debt by 83 million US dollars  The stipulation of the US reducing Botswanas debt is that Botswana will focus on more extensive conservation of the landThe Nations Development Programme claims that a major problem behind the overexploitation of resources including land in Botswana is due to the poverty level  To help change this the UNDP joined in with a project started in the southern community of Struizendam in Botswana  The purpose of the project is to draw from indigenous knowledge and traditional land management systems  The leaders of this movement are supposed to be the people in the community in order to draw these in in turn increasing their possibilities to earn an income and thus decreasing poverty  The UNDP also stated that the government has to effectively implement policies to allow people to manage their own local resources and are giving the government information to help with policy developmentDefenceAt the time of independence Botswana had no armed forces It was only after attacks from the Rhodesian and South African armies that the Defence Force BDF was formed in selfdefence in 1977 The president is commander in chief and appoints a defence council The BDF has approximately 12000 membersFollowing political changes in South Africa and the region the BDFs missions have increasingly focused on prevention of poaching preparing for disasters and foreign peacekeeping The United States has been the largest single foreign contributor to the development of the BDF and a large segment of its officer corps has received US training It is considered an apolitical and professional institutionEconomyFileMochudijpgthumbMochudi one of the larger villages in

named in honour of Princess LouiseThe current Premier of the province is Redford Geography Alberta with an area of  is the fourth largest province after Quebec Ontario and British Columbia To the south the province borders on the parallel north separating it from the US state of Montana while on the north the parallel north divides it from the Territories To the east the meridian west separates it from the province of Saskatchewan while on the west its boundary with British Columbia follows the meridian west south from the Northwest Territories at 60N until it reaches the Divide at the Mountains and from that point follows the line of peaks marking the Continental Divide in a generally southeasterly direction until it reaches the Montana border at 49NThe province extends  north to south and  east to west at its maximum width Its highest point is  at the summit of Mount Columbia in the Rocky Mountains along the southwest border while its lowest point is  on the River in Buffalo National Park in the northeastWith the exception of the semiarid steppe of the southeastern section the province has adequate resources There are numerous rivers and lakes used for swimming fishing and a range of sports There are three large lakes Lake Claire  in Buffalo National Park Slave Lake  and Athabasca  which lies in both Alberta and Saskatchewan The longest river in the province is the River which travels  from the Icefield in the Rocky Mountains to Lake Athabasca The largest river is the Peace River with an average flow of 2161 m3s The Peace River originates in the Rocky Mountains of northern British Columbia and flows through northern Alberta and into the River a tributary of the RiverFileMoraine Lake 17092005jpgthumb250pxrightLake in National ParkAlbertas capital city Edmonton is located approximately in the geographic centre of the province It is the most northerly major city in Canada and serves as a gateway and hub for resource development in northern Canada The region with its proximity to Canadas largest fields has most of western Canadas oil refinery capacity Calgary is located approximately  south of Edmonton and  north of Montana surrounded by extensive ranching country Almost 75 of the provinces population lives in the CorridorMost of the northern half of the province is forest while the Mountains along the southwestern boundary are largely forested see Mountain forests and Columbia foothills forests The southern quarter of the province is prairie ranging from prairie in the southeastern corner to mixed grass prairie in an arc to the west and north of it The central parkland region extending in a broad arc between the prairies and the forests from Calgary north to Edmonton and then east to Lloydminster contains the most fertile soil in the province and most of the population Much of the unforested part of Alberta is given over either to grain or to farming with farming more common in the north and centre while ranching and agriculture predominate in the southThe Alberta badlands are located in southeastern Alberta where the Deer River crosses the flat prairie and farmland and features deep canyons and striking landforms Provincial Park near Alberta showcases the badlands terrain desert flora and remnants from Albertas past when dinosaurs roamed the then lush landscape Climate Alberta has a dry climate with warm summers and cold winters The province is open to cold arctic weather systems from the north which often produce extremely cold conditions in winter As the fronts between the air masses shift north and south across Alberta temperature can change rapidly Arctic air masses in the winter produce extreme minimum temperatures varying from  in northern Alberta to  in southern Alberta In the summer continental air masses produce maximum temperatures from  in the mountains to  in southern AlbertaAlberta extends for over  from north to south its climate therefore varies considerably Average temperatures in January range from  in the south to  in the north and in July from  in the south to  in the north  The climate is also influenced by the presence of the Rocky Mountains to the southwest which disrupt the flow of the prevailing westerly winds and cause them to drop most of their moisture on the western slopes of the mountain ranges before reaching the province casting a shadow over much of Alberta The northerly location and isolation from the weather systems of the Ocean cause Alberta to have a dry climate with little moderation from the ocean Annual precipitation ranges from  in the southeast to  in the north except in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains where rainfall can reach  annuallyIn the summer the average daytime temperatures range from around  in the Rocky Mountain valleys and far north to  in the dry prairie of the southeast The northern and western parts of the province experience higher rainfall and lower evaporation rates caused by cooler summer temperatures The south and eastcentral portions are prone to droughtlike conditions sometimes persisting for several years although even these areas can receive heavy precipitationAlberta is a sunny province Annual bright sunshine totals range between 1900 and 2500 hours per year Northern Alberta receives about 18 hours of daylight in the summerIn southwestern Alberta the cold winters are frequently interrupted by warm dry winds blowing from the mountains which can propel temperatures upward from frigid conditions to well above the freezing point in a very short period During one chinook recorded at Creek temperatures soared from  to  in one hour  The region around Lethbridge has the most chinooks averaging 30 to 35 chinook days per year while Calgary has a Christmas only 59 of the time as a result of these winds Northern Alberta is mostly covered by boreal forest and has a climate The agricultural area of southern Alberta have a semiarid steppe climate because the annual precipitation is less than the water that evaporates or is used by plants The southeastern corner of Alberta part of the Triangle experiences greater summer heat and lower rainfall than the rest of the province and as a result suffers frequent yield problems and occasional severe droughts Western Alberta is protected by the mountains and enjoys the mild temperatures brought by winter winds Central and parts of northwestern Alberta in the Peace River region are largely aspen parkland a biome transitional between prairie to the south and boreal forest to the northAfter Ontario Alberta is the most likely region in Canada to experience tornadoes Thunderstorms some of them severe are frequent in the summer especially in central and southern Alberta The region surrounding the Corridor is notable for having the highest frequency of hail in Canada which is caused by lifting from the nearby Rocky Mountains enhancing the updraftdowndraft cycle necessary for the formation of hailImageBanff Trail 2jpgWinter climate at Banff Trail station in CalgaryImageDinosaurProvincialParkHoodoojpgHoodoos in Provincial ParkImageMay 2011 Wildfires in Alberta

other early flowers The advancing summer introduces many flowers of the sunflower family until in August the plains are one blaze of yellow and purple The southern and east central parts of Alberta are covered by a short nutritious grass which dries up as summer lengthens to be replaced by hardy perennials such as the prairie coneflower fleabane and sage Both yellow and white clover fill the ditches with their beauty and aromatic scentsThe trees in the parkland region of the province grow in clumps and belts on the hillsides These are largely deciduous typically aspen poplar and willow Many species of willow and other shrubs grow in virtually any terrain On the north side of the North Saskatchewan River evergreen forests prevail for hundreds of thousands of square kilometres Aspen

Rutherfordjpgrightthumb150pxC Rutherford Albertas first premierThe first people in Alberta were PaleoIndians who arrived in Alberta at least 10000 years ago toward the end of the ice age They probably migrated from Siberia to Alaska on a land bridge across the Strait and then may have moved down the east side of the Mountains through Alberta to settle the Americas Alternatively they may have migrated down the coast of British Columbia and then moved inland Over time they differentiated into various Nations peoples including the Indian tribes of southern Alberta such as those of the Confederacy and the Cree who generally lived by hunting buffalo bison and the more northerly tribes such as the Cree and  Chipewyan who hunted trapped and fished for a livingAfter the British arrival in Canada approximately half of the province of Alberta south of the River drainage became part of Land which consisted of all land drained by rivers flowing into Bay This area was granted by II of England to the Bay Company HBC in 1670 and rival fur trading companies were not allowed to trade in it After the arrival of Canadians in the west around 1731 they settled near fur trading posts establishing communities such as Lac La Biche and Bonnyville Fort La Jonquire was established near what is now Calgary in 1752The Athabasca River and the rivers north of it were not in HBC territory because they drained into the Ocean instead of Hudson Bay and they were prime habitat for furbearing animals The first explorer of the Athabasca region was Pond who learned of the Portage which allowed travel from southern  rivers into the rivers north of Ruperts Land  Fur traders formed the West Company NWC of Montreal to compete with the HBC in 1779 The NWC occupied the northern part of Alberta territory Peter Pond built Fort Athabasca on Lac la Biche in 1778 Roderick Mackenzie built Chipewyan on Lake Athabasca ten years later in 1788 His cousin Sir Alexander Mackenzie followed the Saskatchewan River to its northernmost point near Edmonton then setting northward on foot trekked to the Athabasca River which he followed to Lake Athabasca It was there he discovered the mighty outflow river which bears his namethe Riverwhich he followed to its outlet in the Ocean Returning to Lake Athabasca he followed the Peace River upstream eventually reaching the Ocean and so he became the first white man to cross the North American continent north of MexicoThe extreme southernmost portion of Alberta was part of the French and Spanish territory of Louisiana sold to the United States in 1803 in 1818 the portion of Louisiana north of the FortyNinth Parallel was ceded to Great BritainFur trade expanded in the north but bloody battles occurred between the rival HBC and NWC and in 1821 the British government forced them to merge to stop the hostilities The amalgamated Hudsons Bay Company dominated trade in Alberta until 1870 when the newly formed Government purchased Ruperts Land Northern Alberta was included in the Territory until 1870 when it and Ruperts land became Canadas TerritoriesThe district of Alberta was created as part of the NorthWest Territories in 1882 As settlement increased local representatives to the NorthWest Legislative Assembly were added After a long campaign for autonomy in 1905 the district of Alberta was enlarged and given provincial status with the election of Cameron Rutherford as the first premier Demographics Alberta has enjoyed a relatively high rate of growth in recent years mainly because of its burgeoning economy Between 2003 and

about 315 billion barrels 50 km3 of bitumen are recoverable McMurray one of Canadas fastest growing  cities has grown enormously in recent years because of the large corporations which have taken on the task of oil production As of late 2006 there were over 100 billion in oil sands projects under construction or in the planning stages in northeastern AlbertaAnother factor determining the viability of oil extraction from the sands is the price of oil The price increases since 2003 have made it more than profitable to extract this oil which in the past would give little profit or even a

school systems in that city are counted in the above numbers both of them operate according to Saskatchewan lawFor many years the provincial government has funded the greater part of the cost of providing K12 education Prior to 1994 public and separate school boards in Alberta had the legislative authority to levy a local tax on property as supplementary support for local education In 1994 the government of the province eliminated this right for public school boards but not for separate school boards Since 1994 there has continued to be a tax on property in support of K12 education the difference is that the mill rate is now set by the provincial government the money is collected by the local municipal authority and remitted to the provincial government The relevant legislation requires that all the money raised by this property tax must go to the support of K12 education provided by school boards The provincial government pools the property tax funds from across the province and distributes them according to a formula to public and separate school jurisdictions and Francophone authoritiesPublic and separate school boards schools and schools all follow the Program of Studies and the curriculum approved by the provincial department of education Alberta Education Home schoolers may choose to follow the Program of Studies or develop their own Program of Studies  Public and separate schools charter schools and approved private schools all employ teachers who are certificated by Alberta Education they administer Provincial Achievement Tests and Diploma Examinations set by Alberta Education and they may grant high school graduation certificates endorsed by Alberta Education Universities FileSaint Josephs College University Of Alberta Edmonton Alberta Canada 02Ajpgthumb230pxrightSt Josephs College at the of AlbertaThe of Alberta established in Edmonton in 1908 is Albertas oldest and largest university The of Calgary once affiliated with the University of Alberta gained its autonomy in 1966 and is now the second largest university in Alberta There is also University which focuses on distance learning and the of Lethbridge both of which are located in their title citiesIn early September 2009 Royal University became Calgarys second public university and in late September 2009 a similar move made MacEwan University Edmontons second public university There are 15 colleges that receive direct public funding along with two technical institutes Alberta Institute of Technology and Alberta Institute of TechnologyThere is also a large and active private sector of postsecondary institutions mostly Christian Universities bringing the total number of universities to twelve plus a University in Calgary the only location in Canada Students may also receive government loans and grants while attending selected private institutions There has been some controversy in recent years over the rising cost of postsecondary education for students as opposed to taxpayers In 2005 Premier Klein made a promise that he would freeze tuition and look into ways of reducing schooling costs So far no plan has been released by the government of Alberta Culture FileStampedeRodeo2002JPG200pxrightthumbThe StampedeSummer brings many festivals to the province of Alberta especially in Edmonton The Fringe Festival is the worlds  second largest after Edinburghs Both Calgary and Edmonton host a number of annual festivals and events including folk music festivals With a large number of summer and winter events Edmonton prides itself as being the Festival City The citys heritage days festival sees the participation of over 70 ethnic groups Edmontons Churchill Square is home to a large number of the festivals including the large Taste of Edmonton  Works Art  Design Festival throughout the summer monthsThe City of Calgary is also famous for its Stampede dubbed The Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth The Stampede is Canadas biggest rodeo festival and features various races and competitions such as roping and riding In line with the western tradition of rodeo are the cultural artisans that reside and create unique Alberta western

Most of the major cities have several performing theatre companies who entertain in venues as diverse as Edmontons Arts Barns and the Winspear Centre for Music Both Calgary and Edmonton are home to Football League and Hockey League teams Soccer union and lacrosse are also played professionally in AlbertaPaleontologyFilePachyrhinosaurus skulljpgthumbright200pxPachyrhinosaurus skull Large quantities of this genus are preserved in the FormationAlberta has one of the greatest diversities and abundances of Cretaceous dinosaur fossils in the world Taxa are represented by complete fossil skeletons isolated material microvertebrate remains and even mass graves At least 38 dinosaur specimens are known from the province The Formation Formation and Park Formations collectively comprise the Judith River Group and are the most thoroughly studied dinosaur bearing strata in Alberta The stratigraphy of the River Group has a confusing history due partly to the use of the MontanaAlberta border as an artificial division between equivalent strata The modern Judith River Group stratigraphy was not finalized until 1993 when Eberth and Hamblin divided the Oldman Formation in two to create the new Dinosaur Park Formation The resulting paleontological confusion was resolved by Currie who relocated old quarries dinosaurs had been found in and determined their distribution within the modern stratigraphic frameworkDinosaurbearing strata are distributed widely throughout Alberta The Provincial Park area contains outcrops of the Dinosaur Park Formation and Oldman Formation In the central and southern regions of Alberta are intermittent Formation outcrops In the Valley and Edmonton regions there are exposed Horseshoe Canyon facies Other formations have been recorded as well like the Milk River and Foremost Formations However these latter two have a lower diversity of documented dinosaurs primarily due to their lower total fossil quantity and neglect from collectors who are hindered by the isolation and scarcity of exposed outcrops Their dinosaur fossils are primarily teeth recovered from microvertebrate fossil sites Additional geologic formations that have produced only few fossils are the River Group and Mary River Formations of the southwest and the northwestern Formation The Wapiti Formations contains two Pachyrhinosaurus bone beds that break its general trend of low productivity however The Formation represents strata deposited during a transgression Dinosaurs are known from this Formation but represent specimens washed out to sea or reworked from
