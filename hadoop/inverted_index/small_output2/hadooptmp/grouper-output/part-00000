dinosaur specimens are known the province The Formation Formation Park Formations collectively comprise the Judith River Group are the most studied dinosaur bearing strata in Alberta The stratigraphy of the River Group has a confusing history due partly to the of the MontanaAlberta border as an artificial division between equivalent strata The modern Judith River Group stratigraphy was not

Oldman Formation In the central southern regions of Alberta are intermittent Formation outcrops In the Valley Edmonton regions there are exposed Horseshoe Canyon facies Other formations have been recorded as well the Milk River Foremost Formations However these latter two have a lower diversity of documented dinosaurs primarily due to their lower total fossil quantity neglect from collectors are hindered by the isolation scarcity of exposed outcrops Their dinosaur fossils are primarily teeth recovered from microvertebrate fossil sites Additional geologic formations that have produced only few fossils are the River Group Mary River Formations of the southwest the northwestern Formation The Wapiti Formations two Pachyrhinosaurus bone beds that break its general trend of low productivity
