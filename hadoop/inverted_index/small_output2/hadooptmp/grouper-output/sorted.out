the Labour government won a waferthin majorityThorpe was subsequently forced to resign allegations his private life The partys new leader Steel negotiated the pact with Wilsons successor as Prime Minister Callaghan According to this pact the Liberals would support the government in crucial votes in exchange some influence over policy The agreement lasted 1977 to 1978 proved fruitless two reasons the Liberals key demand representation was rejected most Labour MPs whilst the contacts Liberal spokespersons Labour ministers proved detrimental as finance spokesperson Pardoe the Exchequer Healey who were mutually antagonisticAlliance with Social DemocratsWhen the Labour government fell in 1979 the Conservatives Thatcher won a victory served to push the Liberals back into the margins In 1981 defectors the moderate wing the Labour Party led former Cabinet ministers Jenkins Owen Williams founded the Social Democratic Party The new party the Liberals quickly formed an alliance which briefly topped the opinion polls before being overtaken the Tories fought the 1983 1987 general elections jointly as the Alliance During 1982 1983 at the depths Labours fortunes under Foot there was

few years extremely poor poll results it gradually found much greater electoral success the Liberal Party had done in the postwar era In the 2005 general election the Liberal Democrats elected 62 MPs to the House Commons a far cry the days when the Liberals had just 5 MPs Liberalism as a political force had seemed moribundAs was the case with the Liberal Party for most the 20th century the Liberal Democrats face constant questioning about which the other two parties they are closer to in particular about which they would support in the event a parliament The party is keen to maintain its independent identity argues that the for a modern Liberal force in British politics never been greaterIn the 2010 General Election the Conservative Party won more seats than any other but not enough to form a majority government After days negotiation the Liberal Democrats agreed to join the Conservatives as part a coalition governmentThe post1988 Liberal PartyA group Liberal opponents the merger
